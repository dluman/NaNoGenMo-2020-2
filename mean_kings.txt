In his reign Helos was taken, a place near the mouth of the Eurotas, the last independent hold of the old Achaean population, and the supposed origin of the term "helot". According to Pausanias, he was a commander in the night-expedition against Ampheia, which began the First Messenian War, but died before its 4th year. Archived from the original on 2011-01-11.

Those of you up on your history know Opsites of Lazica. Now that was one mean king.

Opsites (Georgian: ოფსიტე) is the name twice mentioned by the 6th-century East Roman (Byzantine) historian Procopius in his De Bellis, while recounting the events related to the Lazic War (541–562) fought between the Eastern Roman and Sassanid Persian empires over the Caucasian state of Lazica. In the view of Toumanoff, this is highly probable given the fact that Lazica and Abasgia revolted together against the Roman hegemony and Abasgia had long been under Lazic suzerainty. Professor Cyril Toumanoff assumes that, in both cases, Procopius refers to the same person, a member of the Lazic royal family, who became an Abasgian leader. Later in Procopius's work, Opsites appears as ruler of the eastern part of Abasgia, a land north of Lazica (the west was under Sceparnas). Now this woman happened to be a Roman by birth, for the kings of the Lazi from ancient times had been sending to Byzantium, and, with the consent of the emperor, arranging marriages with some of the senators and taking home their wives from there"  He was married to Theodora, of Roman senatorial descent. If Opsites indeed ruled as king, this might have occurred before 541, when Gubazes II was king.

There's this one -- Nimaathap. Mean? I'm not so sure.

After her death, Nimaathap was obviously long remembered and honoured as a co-founder of a new dynasty, as the mortuary service of the 4th dynasty mortuary priest Metjen proves. Some Egyptologists consider mastaba K1 at Beit Khallaf to be hers, because a considerable amount of seal impressions with her name were found inside this tomb. This would have fit with the Ramesside king lists, which let the 3rd dynasty begin with king Nebka. It would also have matched the chronicles of Manetho, who places a king Necherôphes before king Djoser (whom he calls Tósorthrós). In both cases some scholars believe that the connection between the queen's names and the god Apis refers to a somewhat later introduced title of the king: bull of his mother. It is now believed that Nimaathap was a princess of the Northern royal house. Nimaathap may have acted as regent for her son Djoser. Nimaathap's name does not appear in the pyramid necropolis of Djoser at Saqqara; there, her name was replaced by depictions of the god of grief and mummies, Anubis. Metjen was "overseer of the Ka-house of Nimaethap"; thus he oversaw and administered the mortuary cult for the queen. She is known to have enjoyed a long-lasting mortuary cult. This unique title may indicate that Nimaathap gave birth to several throne pretenders. This is based on the fact that most of her seals were found in the tomb of Khasekhemwy at Abydos. King's wife (Egyptian: hemet-nesw). However these theories are now disproven by the large number of seal impressions (and a few stone bowl inscriptions) bearing Nimaathap's titles "mother of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt", "mother of royal children" and "king's wife". It is unknown how many children Nimaathap had. A seldomly mentioned title of executive powers, giving the queen the right to give any command to the royal court. Other seals were found at Beit Khallaf at the burial sites of the mastaba tombs K1 and K2; the relationships of the original tomb owners to Nimaathap are unknown, though. This is similar to the name of queen Khenthap of the 1st Dynasty.

Years ago, I read about Apollodorus of Cassandreia. Pretty nice as far as kings go.

3rd-century BC tyrant of Cassandreia Apollodorus was a tyrant of the ancient Greek city of Cassandreia (formerly Potidaea) in the peninsula of Pallene. But notwithstanding the support which he derived from the Gauls, who were then penetrating southward, he was unable to maintain himself, and in 276 or 275 he was conquered with the help of the pirate Ameinias the Phocian and put to death by Antigonus II Gonatas.

In many ways, we're really talking about Djet. Pretty nice as far as kings go.

DjetWadj, Zet, Uadji, Ouenephes, VavenephisThe famous stela of king Djet which once stood next to his tomb in the Umm el-Qa'ab, Louvre Museum.PharaohReign10 years, ca. Abydos, Umm el-Qaab, Tomb Z. Djet's tomb is located at Abydos in Petrie's Tomb Z. Also found within the tomb was an ivory comb with the name of Djet on it, along with a picture of the stele. The reason for the 45 days of interregnum is unknown. However, finds of vessel fragments and seal impressions prove that there were intense trading activities with Syria and Palestine at the time. Found within Djet's tomb was a stele. The tombs were later renovated because of the association with the cult of Osiris. Another artistic landmark dated to Djet's reign is his ivory comb  now housed in the Egyptian Museum. According to Wolfgang Helck he reigned 10 years. There is a possibility that a woman known as Ahaneith was also one of his wives. It is located west of his father, King Djer's tomb. It is carved in relief with Djet's Horus name, and shows that the distinct Egyptian style had already become fully developed at that time. This stele was a snake surmounted by a falcon (Horus) and could be interpreted to mean "Horus the snake". Clay seals prove that the official Amka begun his career under king Djer, as manager of the "Hor-sekhenti-dju" estate. The reading of the events described on the tablets is highly problematic. Other activities can be inferred from the only two known years tablets of the ruler, one of which is preserved in two copies. Finally, in Marsa Alam in Nubia, the short inscription "Hemka" below "Djet" was discovered. Copper tools and pottery were also found in the tomb, a common find in Egyptian tombs.

Kaybʼil Bʼalam (alternatively written Kaibil Balam) was a 16th-century leader of the Mam people in the Maya kingdom in the western highlands of Guatemala. However, due to the Spanish conquest, the people returned to the stone fortifications of Zaculeu for protection. The city was attacked in 1525 by conquistador Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of Pedro de Alvarado.

In one night and one day, she covered a distance of 100 stades (roughly 184.81 kilometers), and arrived at the palace, surprising the inhabitants and killing all the guards. As the prince was taken off guard, and perceived her force to be larger than it really was, she was able to charge and personally kill him, as well as his friends and relatives. This took place towards the end of the second century, BC.

Years ago, I read about Ramdev Pir. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

Temples in his name are found in many states of India. "Hindu's converge at Ramapir Mela near Karachi seeking divine help for their security - The Times of India". The two substitutions involve Balarama, Krishna and Buddha is considered the avatar of Vishnu. Krishna is almost always included; in exceptions, he is considered the source of all avatars. Among Muslims, Ramdevji is known as Ramapir. a b A call to honour: in service of emergent India by Jaswant Singh. There is also a temple of Ramdev Pir in Chelhar, Sindh, Pakistan. The toymaker, however, stole most of the new cloth for his wife, and made the wooden horse from a piece of old cloth, with only a cover from new cloth. Shri Ramdev Baba Mandir, Railtoli, Gondia Other temples are in various other districts like Wardha, Jalna, Aurangabad, and Dhamangaon. He is regarded as an incarnation of Vishnu. Their graves are located near Ramdev's samadhi. Many poets and followers like Harji Bhati, Raja Mansinh, Likhmauji Mali, Vijoji Sani, Hiranand Mali, Devshi Mali and Rani Rupande composed folk-tales about him which are still sung by his followers. The five Pirs, who came to test his powers, were so impressed by him that they decided to stay with him. 1409–1442) is a Hindu folk deity of Rajasthan, India. During the mela, people carry flags in their hands and recite bhajans whole night sitting outside the city, and early in the morning at 5:00 AM they hoist the Dhaja (flag) at the temple by dancing on the beat of drums and trumpets. The temple complex housing the resting place of Ramdev is located at Ramdevra (10 km from Pokhran) in Rajasthan. Lakhs of devotees flock this festival of Mandap to have a darshana of the event. Since then, he has been venerated by Muslims as Ramshahpir or Ramapir. Gopal Bajaj is a singer and musician from Hyderabad, best known for his performances for many Ramdevji bhajans. Legend has it that five Pirs from Mecca came to test Ramdev's powers. Ramdev was born on Bhadra Shukla Dooj in c.1405 in a Meghwansi family at Ramderiya. The man brought an earthen lamp from the original temple of Rama Pir in Rajasthan to Tando Allahyar and built a temple. Although Ramdev was cremated in Rajasthan, he had come to Tando Allahyar and his devotees had constructed a temple in his memory at the place where he had worshiped as far back as 1800. Ramdev's parents got angry with the toymaker and imprisoned him. Several fairs in Rajasthan are held to commemorate him. The Stambha stands erect for exactly a day and returns to its original position 24 hours later. His father gave a toymaker sandalwood and new cloth to make a wooden horse. Since then, a fair is held at the Rama Pir temple by his devotees every year. Ramdev welcomed them, and requested them to have lunch with him. The highlight of the festival is an event in which a long (almost 60 feet or more in height) wooden log, called the Stambha, is decorated and laid on the ground with a loose base, with eight ropes tied to it from eight directions. The present temple structure was built around Ramdev's final resting place by Maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner in 1931. The Pirs declined, saying that they ate only with their personal utensils, which were in Mecca. In Rajasthan, today is a public holiday to honour the most famous folk deity called Bhagwan Ramdevji Maharaj revered both by Hindus and Muslims. In Rajasthan, Ramdev is the chief deity of the Meghwal community, worshiped during Vedwa Punam (August – September). 24 Banis are considered as famous literature composed by Ramdev.

This was granted, and Bishr returned with Ghassan to Iraq in 831. This time, Bishr decided to surrender and requested that Ghassan give him a guarantee of safe conduct. In spite of this agreement, however, Bishr soon decided to rebel against the caliph, and stopped forwarding any money to Baghdad. Al-Ma'mun agreed to recognize him as governor, on the condition that Bishr send a million dirhams in tribute to him on an annual basis. Bishr, however, defeated Hajib and forced him to retreat from the province.

I've heard about Samsu-Ditana. Was known to have a pretty regular mean streak.

Babylon was left in ruins and was not reoccupied until the advent of the Kassite dynasty, where documents from Tell Muḥammad are dated by the number of years after it was resettled for the reign of Šipta'ulzi. His reign is best known for its demise with the sudden fall of Babylon at the hands of the Hittites. None of his inscriptions have survived. Samsu-ditāna apparently feared an attack as evidenced in extant tamitu texts, oracle questions addressed to the gods Šamaš and Adad, which name seven “rebel” enemies. For the most part, he appears to have been non-belligerent and content to stay at home at the seat of his kingdom as none of his year names describe the waging of war or the building of monumental edifices. A royal epic of Gulkišar, the 6th king of the 2nd Dynasty of Babylon, the Sealand Dynasty, describes his enmity against Samsu-ditāna. They are about pious gifts to the gods and the erection of statues dedicated to himself.

Well, of all the kings, we should mention Awil-Marduk. Now that was one mean king.

Seder Olam Rabbah assigned twenty-three years to his reign. Awil-MardukKing of BabylonKing of Sumer and AkkadA Babylonian prince named Nabû-šuma-ukîn, son of Nebuchadnezzar II, in custody, makes an appeal to the god Marduk. In the passage, "As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him" (Amos 19), the lion represents Nebuchadnezzar, and the bear, equally ferocious if not equally courageous, is Belshazzar (Esther Rabba, Introduction). 560 BCFatherNebuchadnezzar II Awil-Marduk (Neo-Babylonian: 𒇽𒀭𒀫𒌓 awīl marduk man of Marduk; Hebrew:אֱוִיל מְרֹדַךְ‎‎ ʾĕwīl marōḏaḵ) (died c. 560 BC) was the son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon. The command given to Abraham to cut in pieces three heifers as a part of the covenant established between him and his God, is thus elucidated, "And he said unto him, take unto me three heifers" (Genesis xv. The references in the Talmud and the Midrash to Belshazzar all emphasize his tyrannous oppression of his Jewish subjects. The chronology of the three Babylonian kings is given in the Talmud as follows: Nebuchadnezzar reigned forty-five years, Evil-merodach twenty-three, and Belshazzar was monarch of Babylonia for two years, being killed at the beginning of the third year on the fatal night of the fall of Babylon (Talmud Bavli, Meguila 11b). No personal or historical inscriptions of his reign have been discovered, and there are only two sources of information concerning him—the Hebrew Scriptures and Berosus. The verse in Isaiah xiv 22, "And I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant and son and grandchild, saith the Lord," is applied to the trio. Josephus and the Avot of Rabbi Natan state that the king believed that Jehoiachin was held by his father without cause, and thus decided to release him upon the latter's death. Berossus also notes that "he governed public affairs after an illegal and impure manner," possibly an allusion to actions that infuriated the priestly class, including reforms made to the policies of Nebuchadnezzar. Several passages in the Prophets are interpreted as though referring to him and his predecessors. Tiele, Cheyne, and Hommel are of the opinion that perhaps Neriglissar, Evil-merodach's brother-in-law, who is praised for his benevolence, was instrumental in the freeing of the Judean king. Grätz, on the other hand, conjectures the influence of the Jewish eunuchs (referring to Jer. The three Babylonian kings are often mentioned together as forming a succession of impious and tyrannous monarchs who oppressed Israel and were therefore foredoomed to disgrace and destruction.

One day, Quân confessed to her: "I am a descendant of the Dragon, you are descendant of the Fairy, fire and water cannot live together in harmony." Quân threw the burning metal into Ngư Tinh's mouth. Lạc Long Quân decided to slay the beast to help the people. The beast revealed itself as a huge nine-tailed fox. The innocents were so afraid of the fox that they have to leave their homes, farms to other places in order to live peacefully. He features both in primary education, and in some forms of popular religious belief as a god. Fifty sons followed their mother to the mountainous north, the other fifty followed their father to live in the south; these children are ancestor of Bách Việt. Legacy Most cities in Vietnam have named major streets after him. We are as incompatible as water is with fire. The man went to the seawards with 50 of their children, while his wife went to the mountainous region with the other half of the clan. The fox lived in a deep cave, under a rock mountain in the West Long Biên. This fox has been harassing people from Long Biên to Tản Viên mountain. Whenever the Fish swim, waves can reach the sky, drown multiple ships, all the people passing through the area were all eaten by the fish.

Now let me tell you about Cutzinas. Now that was one mean king.

Shortly after, Cutzinas received the supreme Roman military rank of magister militum from Troglita. Martindale, Jones & Morris 1992, p. 367; 613. Along with the Armenian commander Artabanes, he was sent to pursue Antalas, scoring a victory over the rebel forces near Hadrumetum. This time, Cutzinas opposed the revolt, and brought his own people, the "Mastraciani" (the reading of the name is uncertain) on the side of the Byzantine military. Cutzinas secretly agreed with the Byzantine governor, Areobindus, to betray Antalas, when battle was joined; Areobindus, however, revealed this to Guntharis, a Byzantine commander who was in turn in contact with Antalas and planned to betray Areobindus himself. After his plans were revealed by Guntharis to Antalas, Cutzinas changed sides once more and allied himself with Guntharis, giving his mother and son as hostages. After this, Cutzinas remained as a vassal chieftain, receiving regular pay from the Byzantine authorities. A staunch Byzantine ally during the latter stages of the Berber rebellion, he remained an imperial vassal until his murder in 563 by the new Byzantine governor. To gain time to prepare, Guntharis advised Areobindus to take Cutzinas' children hostage; in the event Guntharis launched an uprising in Carthage which the thoroughly unwarlike Areobindus failed to suppress, resulting in his execution and the usurpation of the governorship by Guntharis. Cutzinas is mentioned by the eyewitness historian Procopius of Caesarea as one of the leaders of the rebellion in the province of Byzacena, alongside Esdilasas, Medisinissas and Iourphouthes. In that year, the Berber rebellion, suppressed by Solomon after his pacification of the tribes of Mount Aurasium in 540, flared up again in Tripolitania and quickly spread to Byzacena, where the Berbers rose up under the leadership of Antalas. Martindale, Jones & Morris 1992, p. 368. Before the Battle of Marta he advocated attacking the rebel forces, but the Byzantine army was heavily defeated by Carcasan and Antalas, who had once more risen in revolt. In spring 535, however, the rebels were defeated by the Byzantine military commander Solomon in the battles of Mammes and Mount Bourgaon, and Cutzinas was forced to flee west to Mount Aurasium in Numidia, where he sought the protection of the local Berber ruler, Iaudas. Life Cutzinas was of mixed stock: his father was a Berber, while his mother came from the Roman population of North Africa.

How about that Tudiya. Mean? I'm not so sure.

These kings at some point became fully urbanized and founded the city-state of Assur. In initial archaeological reports from Ebla, it appeared that Tudiya's existence was confirmed with the discovery of a tablet where it was stated that he had concluded a treaty for the operation of a kārum in Eblaite territory, with "King" Ibrium of Ebla (who is now known to have instead been the vizier of the King Isar-Damu of Ebla.) Both Assyrian and Akkadian traders had spread the use of writing in the form of the Mesopotamian cuneiform script to both Anatolia and the Levant. The region of Assyria, north of the seat of the empire in central Mesopotamia, had been known as Azuhinum in Akkadian records. Nothing concrete is yet known about these names, although it has been noted that a much later Babylonian tablet listing the ancestral lineage of Hammurabi of Babylon, seems to have copied the same names from Tudiya through Nuabu, though in a heavily corrupted form: Tudiya's name seems to be joined with that of Adamu to appear there as Tubtiyamutu. According to the Assyriologist Georges Roux, Tudiya would have lived in the latter half of the 25th century BC (i.e.

I recall Moctezuma II. Now that was one mean king.

And they were all dressed alike except that Moctezuma wore sandals whereas the others went barefoot; and they held his arm on either side. Moctezuma's Palace from the Codex Mendoza (1542) Some of the Aztec stories about Moctezuma describe him as being fearful of the Spanish newcomers, and some sources, such as the Florentine Codex, comment that the Aztecs believed the Spaniards to be gods and Cortés to be the returned god Quetzalcoatl. The Aztecs (2nd edition, revised ed.). As a symbol of resistance against the Spanish, the name of Moctezuma has been invoked in several indigenous rebellions. Through warfare, Moctezuma expanded the territory as far south as Xoconosco in Chiapas and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and incorporated the Zapotec and Yopi people into the empire. Montezuma is a playable ruler for the Aztec in several of the video games of the Civilization series. While some historians such as Warren H. Carroll consider this as evidence that Moctezuma was at least open to the possibility that the Spaniards were divinely sent based on the Quetzalcoatl legend, others such as Matthew Restall argue that Moctezuma politely offering his throne to Cortés (if indeed he did ever give the speech as reported) may well have been meant as the exact opposite of what it was taken to mean, as politeness in Aztec culture was a way to assert dominance and show superiority. Therefore, to give the Spanish the necessary legitimacy to wage war against the indigenous people, Cortés might just have said what the Spanish king needed to hear. As Aztec rulers spoke an overly polite language that needed translation for his subjects to understand, it is difficult to find out what Moctezuma really said. The belief of the Aztecs being rendered passive by their own superstition is referred to by Matthew Restall as part of "The Myth of Native Desolation" to which he dedicates chapter 6 in his book Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest. In 1865 (coincidentally during the Second Mexican Empire), the title, which was held by Antonio María Moctezuma-Marcilla de Teruel y Navarro, 14th Count of Moctezuma de Tultengo, was elevated to that of a Duke, thus becoming Duke of Moctezuma, with de Tultengo again added in 1992 by Juan Carlos I. Descendants of Pedro Tesifón de Moctezuma included (through an illegitimate child of his son Diego Luis) General Jerónimo Girón-Moctezuma, 3rd Marquess de las Amarilas (1741–1819), a ninth-generation descendant of Moctezuma II, who was commander of the Spanish forces at the Battle of Fort Charlotte, and his grandson, Francisco Javier Girón y Ezpeleta, 2nd Duke of Ahumada and 5th Marquess of the Amarillas who was the founder of the Guardia Civil in Spain. " When Moctezuma was allegedly killed by being stoned to death by his own people, "Cortés and all of us captains and soldiers wept for him, and there was no one among us that knew him and had dealings with him who did not mourn him as if he were our father, which was not surprising, since he was so good. Regardless of the earlier orders to hold fire, however, the discussion between Moctezuma and the Aztec leaders was immediately followed by an outbreak of violence. Much of the idea of Cortés being seen as a deity can be traced back to the Florentine Codex, written some 50 years after the conquest. These were purportedly interpreted as signs of a possible disaster, e.g. Symbol of indigenous leadership  Map showing the expansion of the Aztec Empire through conquest. According to an indigenous account, he said to Cortés: "You have come to sit on your seat of authority, which I have kept for a while for you, where I have been in charge for you, for your agents the rulers..." However, these words might be a polite expression that was meant to convey the exact opposite meaning, which was common in Nahua culture; Moctezuma might actually have intended these words to assert his own stature and multigenerational legitimacy. An elementary school in Albuquerque, New Mexico is named Montezuma Elementary School, after him. Other holders of Spanish noble titles that descend from the Aztec emperor include Dukes of Atrisco. At some time during that period, Moctezuma became a prisoner in his own house. According to Cortés, Moctezuma immediately volunteered to cede his entire realm to Charles V, King of Spain. He had many women as his mistresses, the daughters of chieftains, but two legitimate wives who were Caciques[N.B. a comet, the burning of a temple, a crying ghostly woman, and others. Four leaders of the Aztec army met with Moctezuma to talk, urging their countrymen to cease their constant firing upon the stronghold for a time. Moctezuma ordered that he be kept informed of any new sightings of foreigners at the coast and posted extra watch guards to accomplish this. A nephew of Moctezuma II was Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin. Cortés later melted these down for their monetary value. In an effort to pacify his people, and undoubtedly pressured by the Spanish, Moctezuma was struck dead by a rock. Indeed, when we least expected it, they came to say that he was dead. The details of his death are unknown, with different versions of his demise given by different sources. The veracity of this claim is difficult to ascertain, though some recent ethnohistorians specialising in early Spanish/Nahua relations have discarded it as post-conquest mythicalisation. Other references Moctezuma River and Mount Moctezuma, a volcano in Mexico City, are named after him. His prose is characterized by simple descriptions and explanations, along with frequent personal addresses to the King. " His name glyph, shown in the upper left corner of the image from the Codex Mendoza above, was composed of a diadem (xiuhuitzolli) on straight hair with an attached earspool, a separate nosepiece, and a speech scroll. The Millennial Kingdom of the Franciscans in the New World: A Study of the Writings of Gerónimo de Mendieta (1525–1604) (2nd edition, revised ed.). I have spoken of the sorrow we all felt when we saw that Montezuma was dead. " Díaz alleges that the Aztecs informed Moctezuma that a relative of his had risen to the throne and ordered their attack to continue until all of the Spanish were annihilated, but expressed remorse at Moctezuma's captivity and stated that they intended to revere him even more if they could rescue him. He described Moctezuma's issue and estimates them to be nineteen – eleven sons and eight daughters. Indigenous accounts of omens and Moctezuma's beliefs Bernardino de Sahagún (1499–1590) includes in Book 12 of the Florentine Codex eight events said to have occurred prior to the arrival of the Spanish. The Nahuatl pronunciation of his name is [motekʷˈsoːma]. Xocoyotzin (IPA: [ʃokoˈjotsin]) means "honored young one" (from "xocoyotl"  + suffix "-tzin" added to nouns or personal names when speaking about them with deference). One is of the death of Moctezuma II, which the indigenous assert was due to the Spaniards. By the Princess Acatlan were left two daughters, baptized as Maria and Marina (also known as Leonor); the latter alone left offspring, from whom descends the Sotelo-Montezuma family. By the following year, the Aztec Empire had fallen to an army of Spanish and their Native American allies, primarily Tlaxcalans, who were traditional enemies of the Aztecs. It is possible that his chronicle relates mostly the genealogy of the Aztec rulers. Several species of animals and plants such as Montezuma quail, Montezuma oropendola, Argyrotaenia montezumae, and Pinus montezumae have been named after him. 3] in their own right, and only some of his servants knew of it. By her he left a son, Asupacaci, who fell during the Noche Triste, and a daughter, Tecuichpoch, later baptized as Isabel Moctezuma. " Anthony Pagden and Eulalia Guzmán have pointed the Biblical messages that Cortés seems to ascribe to Moctezuma's retelling of the legend of Quetzalcoatl as a vengeful Messiah who would return to rule over the Mexica. Archived from the original (PDF) on 2012-07-01. Hubert Howe Bancroft, writing in the 19th century (Native Races, Volume #3), speculated that the name of the historical Aztec emperor Moctezuma had been used to refer to a combination of different cultural heroes who were united under the name of a particularly salient representative of Mesoamerican identity. In his Second Letter, Cortés describes his first encounter with Moctezuma thus: "Moctezuma   came to greet us and with him some two hundred lords, all barefoot and dressed in a different costume, but also very rich in their way and more so than the others. In the codex's description of the first meeting between Moctezuma and Cortés, the Aztec ruler is described as giving a prepared speech in classical oratorical Nahuatl, a speech which as described verbatim in the codex (written by Sahagún's Tlatelolcan informants) included such prostrate declarations of divine or near-divine admiration as, "You have graciously come on earth, you have graciously approached your water, your high place of Mexico, you have come down to your mat, your throne, which I have briefly kept for you, I who used to keep it for you," and, "You have graciously arrived, you have known pain, you have known weariness, now come on earth, take your rest, enter into your palace, rest your limbs; may our lords come on earth." The clothes he wore one day he did not wear again till three or four days later. In his Historia, Bernal Díaz del Castillo states that on 1 July 1520, the Spanish forced Moctezuma to appear on the balcony of his palace, appealing to his countrymen to retreat. Ethnohistorian Susan Gillespie has argued that the Nahua understanding of history as repeating itself in cycles also led to a subsequent rationalization of the events of the conquests. Montezuma is mentioned in Neil Young's song "Cortez the Killer", from the 1975 album Zuma (the title of which is also believed to derive from "Montezuma"). "Did Emperor Moctezuma II's head injury and subsequent death hasten the fall of the Aztec nation?". Díaz states: "Many of the Mexican Chieftains and Captains knew him well and at once ordered their people to be silent and not to discharge darts, stones or arrows, and four of them reached a spot where Montezuma could speak to them. As Aztec culture made class distinctions between the children of senior wives, lesser wives, and concubines, not all of his children were considered equal in nobility or inheritance rights. Moctezuma was then succeeded by his brother Cuitláhuac, who died shortly after during a smallpox epidemic. Historical portrayals of Moctezuma have mostly been colored by his role as ruler of a defeated nation, and many sources have described him as weak-willed, superstitious, and indecisive. The conquests of Moctezuma II are marked by the colour green (based on the maps by Ross Hassig in Aztec Warfare). There he married Francisca de la Cueva de Valenzuela. 1], variant spellings include Motecuhzomatzin, Montezuma, Moteuczoma, Motecuhzoma, Motēuczōmah, Muteczuma, and referred to retroactively in European sources as Moctezuma II, was the ninth tlatoani or ruler of the Aztec Empire, reigning from 1502 to 1520. He changed the previous meritocratic system of social hierarchy and widened the divide between pipiltin (nobles) and macehualtin (commoners) by prohibiting commoners from working in the royal palaces. A reconstructed portrait of Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin, based on historical sources, in a contemporary style. In 1766, the holder of the title became a Grandee of Spain. On the facade of the Royal Palace of Madrid there is a statue of the emperor Moctezuma II, along with another of the Inca emperor Atahualpa, among the statues of the kings of the ancient kingdoms that formed Spain. "Montezuma's Revenge" is a colloquialism for traveler's diarrhea in visitors to Mexico. " Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún recorded two versions of the conquest of Mexico from the Tenochtitlán-Tlatelolco viewpoint.

There's this one -- Ansud. Now that was one mean king.

Alfonso Archi, recognized that this verb is a personal name of a monarch and read it as Anubu (motivated by the Sumerian King List which record a dynasty of Mari and king Anbu as the first monarch of the dynasty). However, the discovery of an intact (SKL) with the names of Mari's dynasty bearing no resemblance to second kingdom monarchs, eliminated the need for Archi's identification. However, this identification was ruled as geographically impossible by Astour. The letter of Enna-Dagan is extremely difficult to read, and the word "Sa'umu" appeared in three passages of it. According to Michael Astour, the name is Anusu (Ansud) and must be correlated with king Hanusum. [note 1] The king is also mentioned leaving ruins in the mountains of Labanan, which were identified by Pettinato with Lebanon.

I'd like to address the legacy of Sargon of Akkad. Now that was one mean king.

This is the modern village of Armûdja, a hamlet some three miles south of Killis, not on the coast at all, but in the heart of Syria, and with no known classical background." For the YouTuber, see Carl Benjamin. History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine "Firsts" in Recorded History. This "Shar-Gani" was identified with the Sargon of Agade of Assyrian legend. Their cities were sacked; the governors, viceroys, and kings of Susa, Waraḫše, and neighboring districts became vassals of Akkad. The Sargon Legend: A Study of the Akkadian Text and the Tale of the Hero Who Was Exposed at Birth. Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus showed great interest in the history of the Sargonid dynasty and even conducted excavations of Sargon's palaces and those of his successors. the Silver mountains must be the Ala-Dagh, where at Bereketli Maden there are extensive remains of ancient silver mines";  c.f. A Neo-Assyrian text from the 7th century BC purporting to be Sargon's autobiography asserts that the great king was the illegitimate son of a priestess. "Yarmuti is probably the Yarimuta of the Tel el-Amarna letters, the name of which seems to be preserved in that of Armuthia south of Killiz. Joachim Menant published a description of this seal in 1877, reading the king's name as Shegani-shar-lukh, and did not yet identify it with "Sargon the Elder" (who was identified with the Old Assyrian king Sargon I). From the rising of the sun unto the setting of the sun they opposed him and gave him no rest. Sargon I was a king of the Old Assyrian period presumably named after Sargon of Akkad. "The black-headed peoples I ruled, I governed; mighty mountains with axes of bronze I destroyed. The Assyrian and Babylonian kings who based their empires in Mesopotamia saw themselves as the heirs of Sargon's empire. The part of the interpretation of the king's dream has parallels to the biblical story of Joseph, the part about the letter with the carrier's death sentence has similarities to the Greek story of Bellerophon and the biblical story of Uriah. It is an older version of the previously-known Assyrian legend, discovered in 1974 in Nippur and first edited in 1983. Similarities between the Sargon Birth Legend and other infant birth exposures in ancient literature, including Moses, Karna, and Oedipus, were noted by psychoanalyst Otto Rank in his 1909 book The Myth of the Birth of the Hero. The god Enlil gave to him  the [Lower (Sea). Whatsoever king shall be exalted after me, ... Let him rule, let him govern the black-headed peoples; mighty mountains with axes of bronze let him destroy; let him ascend the upper mountains, let him break through the lower mountains; the country of the sea let him besiege three times; Dilmun let him capture; To great Dur-ilu let him go up." The names of these four years describe his campaigns against Elam, Mari, Simurrum (a Hurrian region), and Uru'a (an Elamite city-state). An older version of the king list gives Sargon's reign as lasting for 40 years. His successors until the Gutian conquest of Sumer are also known as the "Sargonic Dynasty" and their rule as the "Sargonic Period" of Mesopotamian history. Archived from the original on 8 May 2008. Sargon was regarded as a model by Mesopotamian kings for some two millennia after his death. He entertained a court or standing army of 5,400 men who "ate bread daily before him". The Sumerian king list makes him the cup-bearer to king Ur-Zababa of Kish. He washed his weapons in the sea. He (Dagan) gave to him (Sargon) the Upper Land: Mari, Iarmuti, and Ebla, as far as the Cedar Forest and the Silver Mountains"— Nippur inscription of Sargon. Only the beginning of the text (the first two columns) is known, from the fragments of three manuscripts. He frequently calls himself "king of Akkad" first, after the city of Akkad which he apparently founded. Ur-Zababa and Lugal-zage-si are both listed as kings, but separated by several additional named rulers of Kish, who seem to have been merely governors or vassals under the Akkadian Empire. In addition to the Biblical form (סרגון), the Hebrew spelling סרגן has been found in an inscription in Khorsabad, suggesting that the name in the Neo-Assyrian period might have been pronounced Sar(ru)gīn, the voicing representing a regular development in Neo-Assyrian. the indigenous population of Mesopotamia) as he did. The identification of "Shar-Gani-sharri" with Sargon was recognised as mistaken in the 1910s. He usurped the kingship from Lugal-zage-si of Uruk and took it to his own city of Akkad. The name of the Old Assyrian king Sargon I is spelled as LUGAL-ke-en or LUGAL-ki-in in king lists. Here, Sargon is mentioned as the son of a gardener, former cup-bearer of Ur-Zababa of Kish. The Hittite version is extant in six fragments, the Akkadian version is known from several manuscripts  found at Amarna, Assur, and Nineveh. Sargon is the earliest known ruler with a Semitic name for whom anything approaching a historical context is recorded. When Sargon returns to Ur-Zababa, the king becomes frightened again and decides to send Sargon to king Lugal-zage-si of Uruk with a message on a clay tablet asking him to slay Sargon. Inventing Empire in Ancient Mesopotamia, Routledge, 2016. He brought it under one authority. The tablet is a copy of the inscriptions on the pedestal of a Statue erected by Sargon in the temple of Enlil. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me. Sargon appears as a legendary figure in Neo-Assyrian literature of the 8th to 7th centuries BC. The braided hair and royal bun, reminiscent of the headgears of Meskalamdug, Eannatum or Ishqi-Mari, are particularly visible. Famine and war threatened Sargon's empire during the latter years of his reign. This is one of the few films, if not the only one, to depict Sargon. In the east, Sargon defeated four leaders of Elam, led by the king of Awan. He was victorious over Umma in battle, [conquered the city, and destroyed its walls]. Stephanie Dalley, Sargon of Agade in literature: "The episode of dreams which Joseph interpreted for Pharaoh in Genesis 37 bears a notable resemblance to Sargon’s interpretation of the dreams of the king of Kish in the Sumerian Legend of Sargon, the same legend contains the motif of the messenger who carries a letter which orders his own death, comparable to the story of Uriah in 2 Samuel 11 (and of Bellerophon in Iliad 6). Two other sons, Shu-Enlil (Ibarum) and Ilaba'is-takal (Abaish-Takal), are known. The first fragments were discovered as early as 1850. Bendt Alster, "A Note on the Uriah Letter in the Sumerian Sargon Legend", Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und Vorderasiatische Archäologie 77.2 (1987). Sargon may indeed have introduced the notion of "empire" as understood in the later Assyrian period; the Neo-Assyrian Sargon Text, written in the first person, has Sargon challenging later rulers to "govern the black-headed people" (i.e. The narrative is anachronistic, portraying Sargon in a 19th-century milieu. Manishtushu would be succeeded by his own son, Naram-Sin. There are, however, older references to rulers bearing Semitic names, notably the pre-Sargonic king Meskiang-nunna of Ur by his queen Gan-saman, mentioned in an inscription on a bowl found at Ur. Its text was edited by Arno Poebel (1909) and Leon Legrain (1926). He was the founder of the "Sargonic" or "Old Akkadian" dynasty, which ruled for about a century after his death until the Gutian conquest of Sumer. A contemporary reference to Sargon thought to have been found on the cylinder seal of Ibni-sharru, a high-ranking official serving under Sargon. Sargon of Akkad (/ˈsɑːrɡɒn/; Akkadian: 𒊬𒊒𒄀 Šar-ru-gi), also known as Sargon the Great, was the first ruler of the Akkadian Empire, known for his conquests of the Sumerian city-states in the 24th to 23rd centuries BC. The country of the sea I besieged three times; Dilmun I captured. " The Chronicle of Early Kings (ABC 20:18–19) likewise states that late in his reign, Sargon "dug up the soil of the pit of Babylon, and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Agade. He set up his statues there and ferried the west's booty across on barges. Unto the great Dur-ilu I went up, I ... The legend breaks off at this point; presumably, the missing sections described how Sargon becomes king. Perhaps the Yari-muta of the Tel el‑Amarna tablets, now (I think) Armūthia, south of Killis."

He stationed his court officials at intervals of five double hours and ruled in unity the tribes of the lands. {P3+BT14: 157 are the years of the dynasty of Sargon.}" Man-ištiššu, the older brother of Rīmuš, the son of Sargon, ruled for {WB: 15} {L1+N1: 7} years. He also names various rulers of the east whom he vanquished, such as "Luh-uh-ish-an, son of Hishibrasini, king of Elam", king of Elam" or " Sidga'u, general of Parahshum", who later also appears in an inscription by Rimush. Although historically inaccurate and supernatural in nature, The Scorpion King: Rise of a Warrior (2008) features Sargon of Akkad as a murderous army commander who uses black magic.

Sargon is also one of the many suggestions for the identity or inspiration for the biblical Nimrod. Šar-kali-šarrī, the son of Narām-Suen, ruled for {L1+N1, Su+Su4: 25; P3+BT14: 24} years. " Van de Mieroop suggested that those two chronicles may refer to the much later Assyrian king, Sargon II of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, rather than to Sargon of Akkad. In addition, the names of some pre-Sargonic rulers of Kish in the Sumerian king list have been interpreted as having Semitic etymologies, which might extend the Semitic presence in the Near East to the 29th or 30th century. He conquered Eninmar, destroyed its walls, and conquered its district and Lagash as far as the sea. This article is about the Akkadian king. Ewing William (1910) suggested Sargon based on his unification of the Babylonians and the Neo-Assyrian birth legend. He marched to Kazallu and turned Kazallu into a ruin heap, so that there was not even a perch for a bird left. She cast me into the river which rose over me. Sargon was succeeded by his son Rimush; after Rimush's death another son, Manishtushu, became king.

In the same year, he granted 27.25 hals of land to Syed Muhammad Najat Khan of Sylhet, whose heir was Ahsanullah, in the parganas of Kauria and Atuajan. In 1685, Nawab Abd ar-Rahman Khan was the Naib-Faujdar. On 2 January, the fleet split ways with Farhad and Murtaza going through land with the other leaders going through the river. Farhad built the single-domed Bara Gambuz hall south of Shah Jalal's Dargah in 1677. Farhad led an expedition to Bhulua ruled by Raja Lakshmana Manikya of the Bishwambhar Sur dynasty, and the expedition resulted in a swift Mughal victory. He was renowned for the construction of numerous bridges and places of worship in the region. In 1684, Khan built another mosque in Raihusayn Mahalla (Rainagar). In 1678, Khan gifted 5.75 haals of land to Ratneshwar Chakraborty in Longla Pargana. Farhad later sent them off to the Subahdar of Bengal Shaista Khan in Jahangirnagar. Farhad was the thanadar of Bhulua (Greater Noakhali). Shaista Khan also ordered Mir Murtaza, the superintendent of artillery, to join and protect Farhad. Ghatforhadbeg (Ghat Farhad Beg), a ghat which used to be on the Karnaphuli is named after him. He also granted land to Ramapati Chakrabarti, father of Srikrishna Chakrabarty of Ita, in Alinagar Pargana as well as giving land in Bejura Pargana to Ramkanta Chakrabarti of Qasimnagar, whose heir was Balaram Bisharad. Nawab Nasrullah Khan, Naib in 1683, granted land to Pandit Ramgovinda Bhattacharjee in Chowallish. Farhad Khan left Sylhet for a short while in 1678. He was the most well-known Faujdar of Sylhet Sarkar, governing in the late 17th century during the reign of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.

I'd be remiss if I forgot Mukarram Khan. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

One day, he ordered for his boat to go back to land so that he could offer the Asr prayer. However, Mukarram politely refused to do so. At the ascension of Emperor Jahangir, the Shaykh became a mansabdar of 3,000 and given the title of Mu'azzam Khan on the 1st of Jumada al-Thani. Mukarram had announced that the march shall take place after Iftar, however Nathan's colleague, Shaykh Ashraf of Hansi, disagreed and suggested that they should start marching as there is no enemy behind them. Then Mukarram Khan was appointed the new governor of Bengal. He and his colleagues are considered shahid (martyrs) in Islam. However, Mukarram retreated, leaving Bahadur to give up and make peace with the Empire. His rule in Orissa was said to have been very harsh. Three days later, Mukarram and his forces marched on from Toke and were joined by the forces of Shaykh Kamal and Raja Raghunath. Mukarram kissed his brother's hand and the hands of the other soldiers. Qasim then plotted a plan for the next morning in which when Mukarram enters the court, not to allow many of his men to join him and then forcibly seize Parikshit. :223–224 Emperor Jahangir gave Mukarram a flag on the 11th of February 1614. He was replaced as Subahdar by Fidai Khan. The forces reached Mukarram in three marches and he hosted them in his camp with great veneration. The plan was successful and Mukarram became helpless and returned to his home, in Yarasindur, leaving the Raja. The Shaykh was a grandson of Salim Chishti of Fatehpur Sikri. In Bengal, he would travel around with a boat. Here, Mukarram told his younger brother, Abd as-Salam, to take a boat to Patna and then travel by land to the capital, at Agra, to seek redress from Emperor Jahangir. Before this, he also served as the Thanadar of Bhawal, Governor of Koch Hajo, Sardar of Sylhet and Subahdar of Orissa. Due to a heavy wind, Mukarram and his colleagues drowned thus ending his rule in 1627. :289 Mukarram was later ordered by Qasim to hand over Parikshit to him. Mukarram decided to leave Nathan alone and instead report the matter to the Subahdar, Islam Khan I. Mukarram was very angered by Qasim's actions and marched with his brothers to Jahangirnagar and then to Yarasindur. In 1616, Mukarram gifted the Emperor jewels and offerings from Bengal. Due to this noble background, Emperor Jahangir referred to Mukarram as a khana-zad (a houseborn individual). The Baharistan-i-Ghaibi details the back-and-forth arguments which took place between the two forces during the Hajo expedition. Parikshit was defeated and Mukarram presented him and his sons to the new Subahdar, his uncle, Qasim Khan Chishti. Mukarram's brothers were Abd as-Salam and Muhi ad-Din Shaykh.

In many ways, we're really talking about Ptolemy V Epiphanes. Now that was one mean king.

Ptolemy's childhood friend, the eunuch Aristonicus was sent to Greece to recruit mercenaries in 185 BC. Polybius thought that this will was a forgery produced by Sosibius and Agathocles themselves and modern scholars tend to agree with him. This decree reinstated the honours for Arsinoe Philadelphus and the Theoi Philopatores (Ptolemy IV and Arsinoe III) in the temples of Upper Egypt, which had been abolished during Ankhmakis' revolt. What construction was carried out under Ptolemy V was focussed in the northern part of the country, particularly the sanctuary of the Apis Bull and the temple of Anubis at Memphis. In his view, the priests asserted their right to the remission of taxes, aware that Ptolemy was relying more heavily on their support than his predecessors had, and he had no choice but to concede. Ptolemy V came of age in 196 BC and was crowned as Pharaoh in Memphis, an occasion commemorated by the creation of the Rosetta Stone. A Roman embassy made an ineffectual attempt to broker a peace between Ptolemy V and Antiochus III, but largely abandoned the Egyptians to their fate. The first of these decrees was the Memphis decree, passed on 27 March 196 BC, the day after Ptolemy's coronation as Pharaoh, in which Ptolemy V is presented as the 'image of Horus, son of Isis and Osiris'. Polybius writes that Ptolemy's courtiers "thought that the kingdom would gain a certain degree of firmness and a fresh impulse towards prosperity, if it were known that the king had assumed the independent direction of the government. Arthur Eckstein has argued that this collapse sparked the 'power transition crisis' which led to the Roman conquest of the eastern Mediterranean. As aforementioned, he had begun seizing Ptolemaic territory in western Asia Minor in 203 BC and made a pact with Philip V of Macedon to divide the Ptolemaic possessions between themselves late in that year. Popular opinion soon turned against Tlepolemus, who was considered to spend too much time sparring and drinking with the soldiers and to have given too much money to embassies from the cities of mainland Greece. For other uses, see Epiphanes (disambiguation). He escaped and convinced the army to go into active revolt. The Ptolemaic governor of Coele-Syria, Ptolemy, son of Thraseas defected to Antiochus, bringing his territory with him and remaining its governor. The army entered at dawn and Agathocles offered to surrender. It also granted Cleopatra I all the various honours that had been granted to Ptolemy V in the earlier decrees. Hugronaphor was succeeded by or changed his name to Ankhmakis (Ankhwennefer) in late 199 BC. The Ptolemaic general, Scopas led a successful reconquest of Palestine over the winter of 201/200, but Antiochus invaded again in 200 BC and defeated him decisively at the Battle of Panium. At some point over the winter, Tlepolemus was replaced as regent by Aristomenes, a member of the bodyguard who had been instrumental in the seizure of young Ptolemy V from Agathocles. The decree has been interpreted as a reward for the priests' support of Ptolemy against the rebels. In late 196 or early 195 BC Lucius Cornelius Lentulus met with the king and, among other things, demanded that Antiochus return everything he had conquered from Ptolemy V. However, Antiochus announced that he had already begun peace negotiations with Egypt and the Romans departed without achieving anything. Since the death of Arsinoe II, deceased Ptolemaic queens had been honoured with a separate dynastic cult of their own, including a separate priestess who marched in religious processions in Alexandria behind the priest of Alexander the Great and whose names also appeared in dating formulae. This disgusted the Romans who had entered into hostilities with Antiochus partially on Ptolemy's behalf - after their victory, they distributed the old Ptolemaic territories in Asia Minor to Pergamum and Rhodes rather than returning them to Egypt. He and Sosibius, son of Sosibius were also made Ptolemy V's legal guardians. In winter of 194/193 BC, the sixteen-year old Ptolemy V married Cleopatra who was somewhere between 14 and 23 years old. Ludwig Koenen has proposed that 30 Mesore was actually Ptolemy's accession date: Koenen 1977, p. 73 harvnb error: no target: CITEREFKoenen1977 (help). Some time before September 204 BC, the royal bodyguard and army officers were gathered at the royal palace and Sosibius announced the death of the ruling couple and presented the young Ptolemy V to be acclaimed as king, wrapping the diadem around his head. This decree was revised in the Philensis I decree, passed in autumn 185 BC on the enthronement of an Apis Bull. When Antiochus III died in 187 BC and was succeeded by his brother Seleucus IV, Ptolemy V began preparations for a renewed war to recapture Coele-Syria. These honours were augmented in the Philensis II decree passed in September 186 BC on the suppression of Ankhmakis' revolt. Around October or November 197 BC, the Ptolemaic governor of Cyprus, Polycrates of Argos came to Alexandria, and arranged for Ptolemy V to be declared an adult, with a ceremony known as an anacleteria, even though he was only thirteen years old. The conflict continued throughout the infighting of Ptolemy V's early reign and during the Fifth Syrian War. In return for the southern Egyptian city of Syene, Adikhalamani provided some sort of aid which enabled Ankhmakis to recapture Thebes by autumn 195 BC. As under Ptolemy III and IV, the symbiotic relationship between the king and the priestly elite was affirmed and articulated by the decrees of priestly synods. In his early reign, Ptolemy IV successfully defeated the rival Seleucid empire in the Fourth Syrian War (219-217 BC), successfully preventing the Seleucid king Antiochus III from seizing Coele Syria for himself. With the loss of most of the Ptolemaic possessions outside Egypt in the Fifth Syrian War, Cyprus assumed a much more important role within the Ptolemaic empire and this was asserted by the establishment of a centralised religious structure on the island. War with Antiochus III was expected - Agathocles had also sent an embassy under Scopas the Aetolian to hire mercenaries in Greece in preparation for a conflict, although Polybius claims that his true purpose was to replace the Ptolemaic troops with mercenaries loyal to him. That trend continued under Ptolemy V with the establishment of a cult for his mother, Arsinoe III in 199 BC. The new regent, Agathocles was widely reviled and was toppled by a revolution in 202 BC, but the series of regents who followed proved incompetent and the kingdom was paralysed. This led to conflict with Rhodes and the Attalids who also sent embassies to Rome. This was intended to restore land to cultivation that had been abandoned during the prolonged period of warfare. Shortly after this, Agathocles had Moeragenes, one of the royal bodyguard, arrested on suspicion of ties to Tlepolemus and had him stripped and tortured. Ptolemy V, now about seven years old, was taken from him and presented to the people on horseback in the stadium. Agathocles took a number of actions to solidify the new regime. Ptolemy's reign saw greatly increased prominence of courtiers and the Egyptian priestly elite in Ptolemaic political life - a pattern that would continue for most of the rest of the kingdom's existence. In 197 BC, Antiochus turned on the Ptolemaic territories remaining in Asia Minor, conquering their cities in Cilicia, as well as several of their cities in Lycia and Ionia, notably Xanthos, Telmessus, and Ephesus. Agathocles and his family were then dragged into the stadium and killed by the mob. Instead, Antiochus spent 198 BC solidifying his conquest of Coele-Syria and Judea, which would never again return to Ptolemaic control. In 187 BC, Adikhalamani of Meroe pulled out of Syene and abandoned his support for Ankhmakis. Unlike the canephore of Arsinoe II and the athlophore of Berenice II, Arsinoe's priestess had no special title and served for life rather than a single year. Ptolemy V was born in 210 BC, possibly on 9 October and made co-regent with his father shortly thereafter, probably on 30 November. Overnight, the populus besieged the palace calling for the king to be brought to them. Under Ptolemy V there were three of these, all of which were published on stelae in hieroglyphs, Demotic, and Greek were published throughout Egypt. Polycrates now became the chief minister in Alexandria and Aristomenes was forced to commit suicide in the following years The day after Ptolemy's coronation as Pharaoh, a synod of priests from all over Egypt who had gathered for the event passed the Memphis decree. Prominent aristocrats were dispatched overseas - to secure recognition of the succession from foreign powers and to prevent the aristocrats from challenging Agathocles supremacy at home. When the Roman–Seleucid War broke out in 192 BC, Ptolemy V sent an embassy to Rome offering financial and military support, but the Senate refused it, apparently annoyed about the separate peace that Ptolemy had made with Antiochus in 194/3 BC. Ptolemy of Megalopolis was sent to Rome, probably seeking support against Aniochus III. The rebel leaders were taken to Memphis and publicly executed on 26 March 196 BC, during the feast celebrating Ptolemy V's coronation as Pharaoh. He promised the leaders of the rebellion that they would be treated generously if they surrendered. Symbolically, Antiochus held the wedding that sealed his conquest of Coele-Syria at Raphia, the site of his great defeat at the hands of Ptolemy IV. Whether Polycrates or Ptolemy was responsible for this duplicitous cruelty is disputed. His later reign, however was troubled by native Egyptian revolts. Trusting this, they voluntarily went to Sais in October 185 BC, where they were stripped naked, forced to drag carts through the city, and then tortured to death. The most reliable way of determining which Ptolemy is being referred to in any given case is by epithet (e.g. Since this is the date of a major Egyptian festival, some scholars have questioned whether it was his actual birthday. Shortly after this, Ptolemy V launched a massive southern campaign, besieging Abydos in August 199 BC and regaining Thebes from late 199 BC until early 198 BC. This decree praises Ptolemy V's benefactions for the people of Egypt, recounts his victory over the rebels at Lycopolis, and remits a number of taxes on the temples of Egypt. Antiochus then concluded peace with Ptolemy, engaging him to his own daughter Cleopatra I. It also marked the collapse of Ptolemaic power in the wider Mediterranean region. The ancient historians allege that he was poisoned by his courtiers, who believed that he intended to seize their property in order to fund his new Syrian war.

In many ways, we're really talking about Parshatatar. Not the meanest as they come, but let's say they had more bad days than good.

Parshatatar conquered the area and made Idrimi his vassal, Idrimi becoming king of Aleppo. Parshatatar may have been the Mitannian king the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmosis I met at the Euphrates River in a campaign early in his reign (around 1493). Most information we have about the kingdom, especially its early history and kings come from records outside of the state. Mitanni in his time probably extended as far as Arrapha in the east, Terqa in the south, and Kizzuwatna in the West.

I've heard about Hotepsekhemwy. Not the meanest as they come, but let's say they had more bad days than good.

The exact length of his reign is not known; the Turin canon suggests an improbable 95 years while the ancient Egyptian historian Manetho reports that the reign of "Boëthôs" lasted for 38 years. Additionally, Helck assumes that the kings Sneferka and Horus “Bird” were omitted from later king lists because their struggles for the Egyptian throne were factors in the collapse of the first dynasty. As evidence of this, Egyptologists Wolfgang Helck, Dietrich Wildung and George Reisner point to the tomb of king Qaa, which was plundered at the end of 1st Dynasty and was restored during the reign of Hotepsekhemwy. Hotepsekhemwy's name has been identified by archaeologists at Sakkara, Giza, Badari and Abydos from clay seal impressions, stone vessels and bone cylinders. Hotepsekhemwy is commonly identified with the Ramesside cartouche names Bedjau from the Abydos king list, Bedjatau from Giza, Netjer-Bau from the Sakkara king list and the name Bau-hetepju from the royal canon of Turin. It is thought that some kind of philosophic background affected that choice, since the Horus name reveals a clearly defined, symbolic meaning in its translation. Egyptologists such as Flinders Petrie, Alessandro Barsanti and Toby Wilkinson believe it could be the giant underground Gallery Tomb B beneath the funeral passage of the Unas-necropolis at Saqqara. HotepsekhemwyBedjatau, Bedjau, Boethos, BochusStone vase bearing Hotepsekhemwy's serekh, National Archaeological Museum (France).PharaohReign25–29 years (2nd Dynasty; starting c. 2890 BC. Egyptologists consider both statements to be misinterpretations or exaggerations. So Hotepsekhemwy's full name may be read as "the two powers are reconciled" or "pleasing in powers", which suggests a significant political meaning. In this sense, "the two powers" could be a reference to Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt as well as to the major deities Horus and Seth. Egyptologist Wolfgang Helck points to the similar name Bedjatau, which appears in a short king list found on a writing board from the mastaba tomb G1001 of the high official Mesdjeru. The ancient Egyptian historian Manetho called Hotepsekhemwy Boëthôs (apparently altered from the name Bedjau) and reported that during this ruler's reign "a chasm opened near Bubastis and many perished". Although Manetho wrote in the 3rd century BC – over two millennia after the king's actual reign – some Egyptologists think it possible that this anecdote may have been based on fact, since the region near Bubastis is known to be seismically active. Edward Brovarski: Two Old Kingdom writing boards from Giza. The Abydos king list imitates this Old Kingdom name form of “Bedjatau”. He also built a temple near Buto for the little-known deity Netjer-Achty and founded the "Chapel of the White Crown". The Horus name of Hotepsekhemwy is the subject of particular interest to Egyptologists and historians, as it may hint at the turbulent politics of the time. The names "Netjerbau" and "Bau-hetepju" are problematic, since Egyptologists can't find any name source from Hotepsekhemwy's time that could have been used to form them.

Of course, there's House of Astiruwa. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

The Assyrian king Sargon II suspected a conspiracy by Pisiri and reacted by attacking the kingdom of Carchemish, capturing and plundering the capital of the same name. His name is not preserved but it may be that he is an Astiru II who can be hypothetically reconstructed from a very fragmentary text. It is not known if he became king but his son is attested as ruler of Carchemish. In 738 BC Pisiri was tributary to the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III. :94 Before his death, Astiruwa chose his immediate successor Yariri as a regent for his underage son Kamani and his brothers. The only fact known about his time of rule is that he built craft houses. Bearing the titles of country-lord, hero, and king, he ruled at the end of the 9th and the beginning of the 8th century BC, possibly between 848 and 790 BC. The House of Astiruwa was the last known dynasty of rulers of Carchemish. :97 He founded and populated a city named Kamana on a territory bought from a city named Kanapu:76 ff. He may or may not be identical with the son of Šaštura named in Hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions. If he indeed is not identical with the Assyrian Pisiri, the son of Sastura could be a predecessor of Pisiri, possibly the immediate one. One member of the House of Astiruwa may also be referred to in Assyrian sources. Kamani had several building projects, undertook a military conquest and resettled devastated areas. and he was also involved in land sales. Please help improve this section by clarifying or removing indiscriminate details. King Astiruwa is not known from his own inscriptions but is mentioned in inscriptions of his successors or servants. :135 It is not known if he had any predecessors from the same dynastic line, but it is known that two or more unknown kings of some dynastic line occupied the throne of Carchemish between him and the last known preceding ruler of Carchemish, Sangara (last mentioned in Assyrian sources in 848 BC).

Years ago, I read about Nimaathap. Mean? I'm not so sure.

After her death, Nimaathap was obviously long remembered and honoured as a co-founder of a new dynasty, as the mortuary service of the 4th dynasty mortuary priest Metjen proves. Other scholars think that Nimaathap was planned to be buried at Abydos, because of her marriage with Khasekhemwy. see Silke Roth: Die Königsmütter des Alten Ägypten von der Frühzeit bis zum Ende der 12. King's wife (Egyptian: hemet-nesw). This unique title may indicate that Nimaathap gave birth to several throne pretenders. Together, Djoser and Nimaathap arranged the burial. It is unknown how many children Nimaathap had. The relief is evaluated as proof that Nimaathap was still alive at that time and that she participated in at least one Hebsed ceremony. It is now believed that Nimaathap was a princess of the Northern royal house. She is known to have enjoyed a long-lasting mortuary cult. When Khasekhemwy fought the Northern royal house at Upper Egypt and was victorious, Nimaathap was handed over as some kind of trophy. However these theories are now disproven by the large number of seal impressions (and a few stone bowl inscriptions) bearing Nimaathap's titles "mother of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt", "mother of royal children" and "king's wife". Her name also appears on stone slab fragments from Heliopolis. This is similar to the name of queen Khenthap of the 1st Dynasty. This would have fit with the Ramesside king lists, which let the 3rd dynasty begin with king Nebka. Djoser buried his father at the site where Khasekhemwy's house originated from. This is based on the fact that most of her seals were found in the tomb of Khasekhemwy at Abydos. Nimaathap's name also appears in a tomb inscription of the high official Metjen, who held office under the kings Huni and Sneferu.

Now let me tell you about Maga of Characene. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

His coins are in a Parthian style, and the name on his coins is written in Aramaic as mʼg – which is interpreted as Maga. On these coins, he describes himself as son of a King Attambelos who is otherwise unrecorded in history. MagaMaga was a King of Characene a vassal state of the Parthian Empire and important trading city in the Persian Gulf. He is known only from the coins of his son of Maga, who calls himself son of King Attambelos. Characene was the last rump state of the Seleucid Empire. However, the historicity of Abinergaios III is open to question, as he known only from latter Arabic sources and Maga is the last ruler of Characene who is documented by contemporary sources. Maga, therefore, comes as the last recorded successor of Alexander the Great and the end of his rule marks the terminus of the Hellenistic Age.

I recall Puzur-Inshushinak. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

It is now known that his reign in Elam overlapped with that of Ur-Nammu of Ur-III, although the previous lengthy estimates of the duration of the intervening Gutian dynasty and rule of Utu-hengal of Uruk had not allowed for that synchronism. He also engaged in marital alliances, by marrying his daughters to rulers of eastern territories, such as Anshan, Marhashi and Bashime. According to the inscriptions of Ur-Nammu, Puzur-Inshushinak conquered numerous cities in central Mesopotamia, including Eshnunna and Akkad, and probably Akshak. Archived from the original on 2008-05-08. Mesopotamia: Civilization Begins. The prolog to Ur-Namma’s code adds to list the northern Babylonian cities of Marda, GIRkal, Kazalu, and probably Ak ˇsak?, plus their rural settlements." The statue lists the numerous victories of Puzur-Inshushinak over neighbouring territories, and particularly mentions the submission of the king of Shimashki who "kissed his feet". This control was continued by Shulgi as shown by his numerous dedications in the city-state. "Dynasties Élamites d'Awan et de Simaš". Kutik-Inshushinak's first position was as governor of Susa, which he may have held from a young age. He built extensively on the citadel at Susa, and encouraged the use of the Linear Elamite script to write the Elamite language. Ur-Nammu, who styled himself "King of Sumer and Akkad" is probably the one who, early in his reign, reconquered the northern territories that had been occupied by Puzur-Inshushinak, before going on to conquer Susa. The Ur III dynasty had held control over Susa after the demise of Puzur-Inshushinak, and they built numerous buildings and temples there. About 2110 BC, his father died, and he became crown prince in his stead.

I'd be remiss if I forgot Enlil-kudurri-usur. Now that was one mean king.

The Synchronistic King List[i 2] identifies his Babylonian contemporary with Adad-šuma-uṣur, his eventual nemesis. Assyriological Studies presented to F. R. Kraus on the occasion of his 70th birthday. Grayson and others have speculated that this was with the tacit assistance of Adad-šuma-uṣur, but there is currently no published evidence to support this theory. Ninurta-apal-Ekur’s purpose for being in Babylonia is also unknown, whether a political refugee or an administrator of the Assyrian held portion. In the Synchronistic History,[i 3] the battle between him and Adad-šuma-uṣur is given as a pretext for his Assyrian rival, Ninurta-apal-Ekur, a son of Ilī-padâ and descendant of Eriba-Adad I, to “come up from Karduniaš,” i.e. [i 1] Depending on the length of reign one gives to his successor, Ninurta-apal-Ekur, this would have been either from 1187 to 1183 BC or from 1197 to 1193 BC. Only after these events did Adad-šuma-uṣur go on to extend his territory to include the city of Babylon itself. Babylonia, and make a play for the Assyrian throne.

Those of you up on your history know Jie of Xia. Now that was one mean king.

And while he was drinking wine it was required that he ride on someone’s back like a horse. About the same time, he destroyed the pyramid of Rong (容台), and quelled a rebellion by the Quanyi people (aka Fei Barbarians) after they entered Qi, near Fen. Jie ascended to the throne in the year of Renchen (壬辰). Despite this setback, Shang continued to expand on a number of fronts, gathering vassal troops in Jingbo (景亳). He received an envoy from the Qizhong barbarian people(歧踵戎)  . Tang of Shang succeeded as king by Tang, who inaugurated the Shang Dynasty. His parents were Fa of Xia and his wife. The people working for him who could not supply this drink were killed. The Shang army and allied forces conquered Mixu (密須) (today's 密縣), Wei, and attacked Gu (顧), which was also conquered the following year. In his 13th year of the ruling, he moved his capital from Zhenxun to Henan. He drank a type of pure alcohol wine (清醇). In the 11th year, he summoned all his vassals to his court. Han shi waizhuan (韓詩外傳) scroll 2. King Jie of Xia  夏桀王Jie with a Ji, representing oppression, and sitting on two ladies, symbolizing his abuse of power. In the 15th year of Jie’s reign, Tang of Shang began moving Lü (履) to the capital Bo. About two years later Shang sent his minister Yi Yin as an envoy to Jie. Records from the later Qin Dynasty say that during the last year of Jie’s reign, ice formed during the summer mornings and frost occurred through July. He is traditionally regarded as a tyrant and oppressor who brought about the collapse of a dynasty. In the 26th year of Jie’s reign, Shang conquered Wen. King Jie had no known children with his wives. His given name was Lü Gui (履癸). Around the same time Zhong Gu, chief historian of Jie, fled from the Xia to the Shang. He lived there for three years and constructed his tilt palace. Several hundred people were employed just to supply Jie with his meals. The Shang’s power continued to grow. In one speech Tang of Shang said that creating chaos is not something he wanted, but given the terror of Jie, he has to follow the mandate of heaven and use this opportunity to overthrow Xia. He asked Emperor Jie to spare him. Among other things, she liked to drink, enjoyed music, and also had a penchant for jugglers and sing-song girls. Vegetables had to come from the northwest, fish had to be from the East Sea, seasonings and sauces had to come from ginger that grew in the south, sea salt had to come from the north. Jie was also a known alcoholic, but he did not drink regular wine. Around 1600 BCE, Jie was defeated by Tang of Shang, bringing an end to the Xia Dynasty that lasted about 500 years, and a rise to the new Shang Dynasty. About that time, he began using the Nian (輦), or sedan chair, on which he was carried by servants. Anyone that got his meal wrong was beheaded. During Jie's reign, Shang grew in power, initially at the expense of Xia's other vassals. He also pointed out that even Jie’s own military generals would not obey his orders. In one incident Jie was riding the back of a top chancellor like a horse. These began in the 10th year of Jie’s reign, when five stars were seen in the sky in alignment and a meteor shower occurred, followed by an earthquake.

The conserved part of the relief shows the head and upper torso of a seated king figure inside a hebsed-pavilion. Unfortunately, all but the hieroglyph are damaged, leaving room for interpretations. According to Dreyer, Crocodile's name appears in black ink inscriptions on burnt earthen jars and on several seal impressions found in tomb TT 1549 at Tarkhan and tomb B-414 at Abydos. Mainstream Egyptologists consider the sign to be either the name of Crocodile or King Scorpion II. Right of this crest a divine standard is depicted, a recumbent crocodile with two projectings (either lotus buds or ostrich feathers) sprouting out of its back and is sitting on that standard. The whole arrangement is surrounded by rows of crocodiles with rope curls beneath, which seems to point to the proposed reading of Crocodile's royal serekh. The Followers of Horus, Studies dedicated to Michael Allen Hoffman, 1949–1990. He points to guiding inscriptions on the jars mentioning a Hen-mehw ("brought from Lower Egypt"). Dreyer places him in a time shortly before the kings Iry-Hor, Ka and Narmer. They are convinced that Crocodile was a local king who ruled at the region of Tarkhan. One interesting artifact that possibly depicts King Crocodile, was found at Hierakonpolis in the so-called Main deposit.

Who could forget Userkare. Not the meanest as they come, but let's say they had more bad days than good.

Unfortunately, a large lacuna affects the second line of the fourth column of the papyrus on which the list was written, the place were Userkare's name might have been located. In support of the hypothesis that Userkare was a legitimate stopgap ruler, Grimal stresses that he is well attested by historical and contemporaneous sources, in particular the Saqqara Stone. The mallet bears a small inscription giving the name of a crew of workmen "Beloved ones of Userkare" who hailed from Wadjet, the 10th nome of Upper Egypt, located around Tjebu, south of Asyut. Although he is attested in historical sources, Userkare is completely absent from the tomb of the Egyptian officials who lived during his reign. Baud & Dobrev 1995, p. 59, footnote 93. The brevity of his reign implies that the tomb was probably unfinished at his death, making modern identification difficult. The presence of Userkare on the annal can nonetheless be inferred from a large space between the sections concerning the reigns of Teti and Pepi I as well as from traces of a royal titulary in this space. Although the text reporting Userkare's activities is lost, its length suggests that Userkare ruled Egypt for four or less likely two years. Alternatively, he may have been a regent who ruled during Teti's son's childhood who later ascended the throne as Pepi I. In addition, the Egyptian priest Manetho reports that Userkare's predecessor Teti was murdered. Userkare's relation to his predecessor Teti and successor Pepi I is unknown and his reign remains enigmatic. Since Teti was not a son of the last Fifth Dynasty king Unas, some Egyptologists have proposed that Userkare could have been a descendant of a lateral branch of the Fifth Dynasty royal family who briefly seized power in a coup. Baud & Dobrev 1995, p. 59, footnote 94. These workers were likely involved in an important building project, likely to be Userkare's pyramid. Indeed, a large necropolis of Sixth Dynasty administration officials is found there, which according to Dobrev, hints at the nearby presence of a royal pyramid. These fall broadly into two contradictory scenarios: one that sees Userkare as a legitimate ruler or regent, while the other perceives Userkare as an usurper, possibly responsible for the murder of his predecessor Teti. Userkare was possibly also listed on the Turin canon, a king list composed during the reign of Ramesses II (1279–1213 BC). Texts from the Pyramid Age (annotated ed.). The Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev proposed that Userkare's pyramid is located in the area of Saqqara South known today as Tabbet al-Guesh, north-west of the mortuary complex of Pepi I. Mehi's attempt to switch back to Teti was seemingly unsuccessful, as there is evidence that work on his tomb stopped abruptly and that he was never buried there. Unfortunately, an estimated 92% of the original text was lost when the stone was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid, possibly in the late First Intermediate (c. 2160–2055 BC) to early Middle Kingdom period (c. 2055–1650 BC). The theory that Userkare was merely a regent is rejected by many Egyptologists, including Naguib Kanawati, on the basis that Userkare is mentioned on the Turin and Abydos king lists and hold full royal titulary, something reserved exclusively to reigning pharaohs. a b c Baud & Dobrev 1995, p. 59, footnote 92. Furthermore, the tomb of Mehi, a guard who lived under Teti, Userkare and Pepi, yielded an inscription showing that the name of Teti was first erased to be replaced by that of another king, whose name was itself erased and replaced again by that of Teti. The Egyptian-Australian Egyptologist Naguib Kanawati also finds the hypothesis that Userkare was a short-lived legitimate ruler or regent "unconvincing".

Well, of all the kings, we should mention Yellow Emperor. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

" Helmer Aslaksen, a mathematician who teaches at the National University of Singapore and specializes in the Chinese calendar, explains that those who use 2698 BCE as a first year probably do so because they want to have "a year 0 as the starting point", or because "they assume that the Yellow Emperor started his year with the Winter solstice of 2698 BCE", hence the difference with the year 2697 BCE calculated by the Jesuits. He is also sometimes said to have been partially responsible for the invention of the guqin zither, although others credit the Yan Emperor with inventing instruments for Ling Lun's compositions. In the proleptic Julian calendar, the court's calculations would have placed the Yellow Emperor in the late 38th century BCE rather than in the 27th century BCE that is conventional nowadays. Jiangsu, for example counted 1905 as year 4396 (making 2491 BCE the first year of the Chinese calendar), whereas the Minbao (the organ of the Tongmenghui) reckoned 1905 as 4603 (first year: 2698 BCE). He accepted that the ruling house of the Qin dynasty was also issued from the Yellow Emperor, but by stating that Qin Shihuang was in fact the child of Qin chancellor Lü Buwei, he perhaps meant to leave the First Emperor out of Huangdi's descent. Lewis 1990, p. 314, note 116 (huang 黄 as variant); Allan 1991, p. 65 (huang 黄 as taboo character). A 斗 dǒu in Chinese is an entire semantic field meaning the shape of a "dipper", as the Big Dipper (北斗 Běidǒu), or a "cup", signifying a "whirl", and also has martial connotations meaning "fight", "struggle", "battle". This painting is based on the story, first recounted in the Zhuangzi, that the Yellow Emperor traveled to the Kongtong Mountains to inquire about the Dao with the Daoist sage Guangchengzi. During the ensuing Battle of Zhuolu the Yellow Emperor employs his tamed animals and Chi You darkens the sky by breathing out a thick fog. In their attempts to prove that the earliest figures of Chinese history were mythological, Gu and his followers argued that these ancient sages were originally gods who were later depicted as humans by the rationalist intellectuals of the Warring States period.

The Yellow Emperor was credited with an enormous number of cultural legacies and esoteric teachings. Throughout most of Chinese history, the Yellow Emperor and the other ancient sages were considered to be historical figures. Although the traditional Chinese calendar did not mark years continuously, some Han-dynasty astronomers tried to determine the years of the life and reign of the Yellow Emperor. Zhang's reinterpretation of Sima Qian's account "underscored the need to recover the glory of early China. 71 and 117 ("racial loyalty was perceived as an extension of lineage loyalty"; Hon 2010, p. 150 ("call to arms.... to wage a racial war against the Manchus"). This practice was well established in Tang and Song times, when hundreds of clans claimed such descent. A number of overseas Chinese clans that keep a genealogy also trace their family ultimately to Huangdi, explaining their different surnames as name changes claimed to have derived from the fourteen surnames of Huangdi's descendants.

Sima Qian's Shiji (or Records of the Grand Historian, completed around 94 BCE) was the first work to turn these fragments of myths into a systematic and consistent narrative of the Yellow Emperor's "career". Yang thus argued that Huangdi was a later transformation of Shangdi, the supreme god of the Shang dynasty's pantheon. 13–36, ISBN 978-1438435640  – via Project MUSE (subscription required) Puett, Michael (2001), The Ambivalence of Creation: Debates Concerning Innovation and Artifice in Early China, Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, ISBN 0-8047-3623-5. The prohibition was halted during the 1980s when the government reversed itself and resurrected the "Yellow Emperor cult". He next calls upon the drought demon Nüba to dispel Chi You's storm. In addition to tying the Chinese to an ancient center of human civilization in Mesopotamia, Lacouperie's theories suggested that China should be ruled by the descendants of Huangdi.

She argues instead that pre-Shang "'history'," including the story of the Yellow Emperor, "can all be understood as a later transformation and systematization of Shang mythology. Directed by Bai Ke (1914–1964), a former assistant of Yuan Muzhi, it was a propaganda effort to convince speakers of Taiyu that they were linked to mainland people by common blood. The emperor is an important NPC in the action RPG Titan Quest, The player must reach the emperor to learn the truth about Typhon's imprisonment. In 1955, the KMT, which was led by Mandarin speakers and still poised on retaking the mainland from the Communists, sponsored the production of the movie Children of the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi zisun 黃帝子孫), which was filmed mostly in Taiwanese Hokkien and showed extensive passages of Taiwanese folk opera. Both emperors lived in a time of warfare. Xuanyuan is also the name of the star Regulus in Chinese, the star being associated with Huangdi in traditional astronomy. It recounts that Huangdi's father was Shaodian and his mother was Fu Pao (附寶). In the Hall of Supreme Harmony in Beijing's Forbidden City, there is also a mirror called the "Xuanyuan Mirror". A state sacrifice offered to "Huang-Lao jun" was not offered to Huangdi and Laozi, as the term Huang-Lao would have meant a few centuries earlier, but to a "yellow Laozi". Huangdi is sometimes said to have been the fruit of extraordinary birth, as his mother Fubao conceived him as she was aroused, while walking in the country, by a lightning bolt from the Big Dipper. The Yellow Emperor had four wives. Chronological tables published in the 1938 edition of the Cihai (辭海) dictionary followed Sun Yat-sen in using 2698 as the year of Huangdi's accession; this chronology is now "widely reproduced, with little variation. After Emperor Zhenzong (r. 997–1022) of the Song dynasty dreamed of a figure he was told was the Yellow Emperor, the Song imperial family started to claim Huangdi as its first ancestor. In 78 BCE, under the reign of Emperor Zhao of Han, an official called Zhang Shouwang (張壽望) calculated that 6,000 years had passed since the time of Huangdi; the court refused his proposal for reform, countering that only 3,629 years had elapsed. Huangdi was also referred to as "Youxiong" (有熊; Yǒuxióng). " In her view, Huangdi was originally an unnamed "lord of the underworld" (or the "Yellow Springs"), the mythological counterpart of the Shang sky deity Shangdi. She delivered her son on the mount of Shou (Longevity) or mount Xuanyuan, after which he was named. British fantasy writer China Miéville used this story as the basis for his novella The Tain, which describes a post-apocalyptic London. The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon (黃帝內經 Huángdì Nèijīng), which presents the doctrinal basis of traditional Chinese medicine, was named after him. When the Yellow Emperor died, he was succeeded by Chang Yi's son, Zhuan Xu. Ye Shuxian has also associated the Yellow Emperor with bear legends common across northeast Asia people as well as the Dangun legend. Chen's widely circulated pamphlets claimed that the "Han race" formed one big family descended from the Yellow Emperor. In his Danses et légendes de la Chine ancienne ["Dances and legends of ancient China"], for example, Granet argued that these tales were "historicized legends" that said more about the time when they were written than about the time they purported to describe. After 1911, however, the Yellow Emperor as national symbol changed from first progenitor of the Han race to ancestor of China's entire multi-ethnic population. Certain accounts interpret him as the incarnation of the "Yellow God of the Northern Dipper" (黄神北斗 Huángshén Běidǒu),[note 2] another name of the universal god (Shangdi 上帝 or Tiandi 天帝). The Shiji's account was extremely influential in shaping how the Chinese viewed the origin of their history. Lacouperie's "Sino-Babylonianism" posited that Huangdi was a Mesopotamian tribal leader who had led a massive migration of his people into China around 2300 BCE and founded what later became Chinese civilization. In the first half of the 1980s, the Party had internally debated whether this usage would make ethnic minorities feel excluded. As he announced in January of 9 CE: "I possess no virtue,  I rely upon the fact that] I am a descendant of my august original ancestor, the Yellow Emperor..." About two hundred years later a ritual specialist named Dong Ba 董巴, who worked for at the court of the Cao Wei, which had recently succeeded the Han, promoted the idea that the Cao family was descended from Huangdi via Emperor Zhuanxu.

Helmer Aslaksen, "The Mathematics of the Chinese Calendar," Archived April 24, 2006, at the Wayback Machine section "Which Year is it in the Chinese Calendar?" The first issue (Nov. 1905) of the Minbao 民報 ("People's Journal"), which was founded in Tokyo by revolutionaries of the Tongmenghui, featured the Yellow Emperor on its cover and called Huangdi "the first great nationalist of the world. This practice creates an internal void where all the vital forces of creation gather, and the more indeterminate they remain and the more powerful they will be. In the Warring States period (c. 475–221 BCE), the term di on its own could also refer to the deities associated with the five Sacred Mountains of China and colors. To emphasize the religious meaning of di in pre-imperial times, historians of early China commonly translate the god's name as "Yellow Thearch" and the first emperor's title as "August Thearch", in which "thearch" refers to a godly ruler. a b Giles 1898, p. 338, cited in Unschuld & Tessenow 2011, p. 5. Sima Qian's Shiji presented Huangdi as ancestor of the two legendary rulers Yao and Shun, and traced various lines of descent from Huangdi to the founders of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties. In old accounts the Yellow Emperor is identified as a deity of light (and his name is explained in the Shuowen jiezi to derive from guāng 光, "light") and thunder, and as one and the same with the "Thunder God" (雷神 Léishén), who in turn, as a later mythological character, is distinguished as the Yellow Emperor's foremost pupil, such as in the Huangdi Neijing. In order to reign one must "reduce himself" abandoning emotions, "drying up like a corpse", never allowing oneself to be carried away, as according to the myth the Yellow Emperor himself did during his three years of refuge on Mount Bowang in order to find himself. In Han dynasty texts, the Yellow Emperor is also called upon as the "Yellow God" (黃神 Huángshén). Puett 2002, p. 303 ("centralized statecraft"; LeBlanc 1985–1986, pp. The inscription reads: "The Yellow Emperor created and changed a great many things; he invented weapons and the wells and fields system; he devised upper and lower garments, and established palaces and houses. As a cosmological deity, the Yellow Emperor is known as the "Great Emperor of the Central Peak" (中岳大帝 Zhōngyuè Dàdì), and in the Shizi as the "Yellow Emperor with Four Faces" (黃帝四面 Huángdì Sìmiàn). Lewis 2007, p. 556: "modern scholars of myth generally agree that the sage kings were partially humanized transformations of earlier, supernatural beings who figured in shamanistic rituals, cosmogonic myths or tales of the origins of tribes and clans." ), Dōkyo to shukyō bunka 道教と宗教文化 , Tokyo: Hirakawa shuppansha 平和出版社, pp. Also in the 1920s, French scholars Henri Maspero and Marcel Granet published critical studies of China's accounts of high antiquity. Most Chinese noble families also claimed descent from Huangdi. LeBlanc 1985–1986, p. 53 (quotation); Seidel 1969, p. 21 (who calls it "the most ancient document on Huangdi" ["le plus ancient document sur Houang Ti"]); Jan 1981, p. 118 (who calls the inscription "the earliest existing and datable source of the Yellow Emperor cult" and claims that the vessel dates either from 375 or 356 BCE; Chang 2007, p. 122 (who gives the date as 356 BCE); Puett 2001, p. 112 (Huangdi's "first appearance in early Chinese literature is a passing reference in a bronze inscription, where he is mentioned as an ancestor of the patron of the vessel"); Yates 1997, p. 18 ("earliest extant reference" to Huangdi is "in a bronze inscription dedicated by King Wei" (r. 357–320); von Glahn 2004, p. 38 (which calls Qi "the dominant state in eastern China" at the time). It is the place which is no place, where all creation is born and dies. The main support for this theory – as recorded in the Tongdian (801 AD) and the Tongzhi (mid 12th century) – was the Shiji's statement that Huangdi's 25 sons were given 12 different surnames, and that these surnames had diversified into all Chinese surnames. The altars were established at Yong 雍 (near modern Fengxiang County in Shaanxi province), which was the capital of Qin from 677 to 383 BC. " In traditional Chinese accounts, the Yellow Emperor is credited with improving the livelihood of the nomadic hunters of his tribe. Early on, he lived with his tribe near the Ji River – Edwin Pulleyblank states that "there seems to be no record of a Ji River outside the myth" – and later migrated to Zhuolu in modern-day Hebei. In a controversial essay called History of the Yellow Race (Huangshi 黃史), which was published serially from 1905 to 1908, Huang Jie (黃節; 1873–1935) claimed that the "Han race" was the true master of China because it was descended from the Yellow Emperor. It is from this centre that equilibrium and harmony emanate, equilibrium of the vital organs which becomes harmony between the person and the environment. Leibold, James (2006), "Competing Narratives of Racial Unity in Republican China: From the Yellow Emperor to Peking Man", Modern China, 32 (2): 181–220, doi:10.1177/0097700405285275, S2CID 143944346. Yang Kuan, a member of the Doubting Antiquity School (1920s–40s), argued that the Yellow Emperor was derived from Shangdi, the highest god of the Shang dynasty. In 2009 Ma Ying-jeou was the first ROC president to celebrate the Tomb Sweeping Day rituals for Huangdi in person, on which occasion he proclaimed that both Chinese culture and common descent from the Yellow Emperor united people from Taiwan and the mainland. A large number of texts – such as the Huangdi Neijing, a medical classic, and the Huangdi Sijing, a group of political treatises – were thus attributed to him.

Other inventions credited to the emperor include the Chinese diadem (冠冕), throne rooms (宮室), the bow sling, early Chinese astronomy, the Chinese calendar, math calculations, code of sound laws (音律), and cuju, an early Chinese version of football. Puett, Michael (2002), To Become a God: Cosmology, Sacrifice, and Self-Divinization in Early China, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Asia Center, ISBN 0-674-01643-2. In the late Warring States period, the Yellow Emperor was integrated into the cosmological scheme of the Five Phases, in which the color yellow represents the earth phase, the Yellow Dragon, and the center. This name has been interpreted as either a place name or a clan name. Yang Kuan, a member of the same current of historiography, noted that only in the Warring States period had the Yellow Emperor started to be described as the first ruler of China. Nonetheless, Huangdi kept being considered as an immortal: he was seen as a master of longevity techniques and as a god who could reveal new teachings – in the form of texts such as the sixth-century Huangdi Yinfujing – to his earthly followers. According to a definition in apocryphal texts related to the Hétú 河圖, the Yellow Emperor "proceeds from the essence of the Yellow God". Schoenhals, Michael (2008), (subscription required), "Abandoned or Merely Lost in Translation? ), Baopuzi neipian 抱朴子內篇, Taipei: Taiwan shufang chuban youxian gongsi 台灣書房出版有限公司, ISBN 978-986-7332-46-2. Birth According to Huangfu Mi (215–282), the Yellow Emperor was born in Shou Qiu ("Longevity Hill"), which is today on the outskirts of the city of Qufu in Shandong. In 1984, for example, Deng Xiaoping argued for Chinese reunification saying "Taiwan is rooted in the hearts of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor," whereas in 1986 the PRC acclaimed the Chinese-American astronaut Taylor Wang as the first of the Yellow Emperor's descendants to travel in space. This beast explained to him there were 11,522 (or 1,522) kinds of supernatural creatures. He invents carts, boats, and clothing. He then destroys the Nine Li and defeats Chi You. As sovereign of the centre, the Yellow Emperor is the very image of the concentration or re-centering of the self. The Huantou, Miaomin, and Quanrong peoples were said to be descended from Huangdi. "The Tain" was included in Miéville's short-story collection "Looking For Jake" (2005). Claiming descent from illustrious ancestors remained a common tool of political legitimacy in the following ages. He then became a farmer and tamed six different special beasts: the bear (熊), the brown bear (罴; 羆), the pí (貔) and xiū (貅) (which later combined to form the mythical Pixiu), the ferocious chū (貙), and the tiger (虎). Having waned in influence during most of the imperial period, in the early twentieth century Huangdi became a rallying figure for Han Chinese attempts to overthrow the rule of the Qing dynasty, which they considered foreign because its emperors were Manchu people. He was also credited with composing the Four Books of the Yellow Emperor (黃帝四經 Huángdì Sìjīng), the Yellow Emperor's Book of the Hidden Symbol (黃帝陰符經 Huángdì Yīnfújīng), and the "Yellow Emperor's Four Seasons Poem" included in the Tung Shing fortune-telling almanac. In traditional accounts, he also goads the historian Cangjie into creating the first Chinese character writing system, the Oracle bone script, and his principal wife Leizu invents sericulture and teaches his people how to weave silk and dye clothes. Two tombs were built in Shaanxi within the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor, in addition to others in Henan, Hebei and Gansu. Modern Chinese chronology has generally accepted Martini's dates, except that it usually places the reign of Huangdi in 2698 BCE (see next paragraph) and omits Huangdi's predecessors Fuxi and Shennong, who are considered "too legendary to include. "The most ancient extant reference" to Huangdi is an inscription on a bronze vessel made during the first half of the fourth century BCE by the royal family (surnamed Tian 田) of the state of Qi, a powerful eastern state. The Qing dynasty scholar Liang Yusheng (梁玉繩, 1745–1819) argued instead that the hill was named after the Yellow Emperor. a b Lewis 1990, p. 314, note 116. The fact that Huangdi meant "yellow" emperor also served to buttress the theory that he was the originator of the "yellow race".

Of course, there's Bull . I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

However, since the bull sign is never accompanied by a horus falcon or a gold rosette – indicators of rulers in the pre-dynastic period – some researchers doubt that it refers to a king. He suspected that the grave goods, which were intended for King Scorpion I, came from the state domain goods of King "Bull" and thus the bull symbol originated from the name of the latter. It apparently represents a successful campaign by King Scorpion I against King "Taurus." He is considered a ruler of the late pottery neolithic Naqada III culture of southern Egypt. A representation of a bull could represent the king as an attacking force, but it could also be part of a name for a certain place or district (e.g. A bull representation therefore does not necessarily confirm a king's name. For example, the writing expert Ludwig D. Morenz and the Egyptologist Jochem Kahl point out that Egyptian hieroglyphic writing was still in the early stages of development during the pre-dynastic period and that it was extremely unsafe to assign individual pictorial symbols.

Years ago, I read about Apollodorus of Cassandreia. Pretty nice as far as kings go.

3rd-century BC tyrant of Cassandreia Apollodorus was a tyrant of the ancient Greek city of Cassandreia (formerly Potidaea) in the peninsula of Pallene. The ancients mention him along with the most detestable tyrants that ever lived.

Let's consider Piyassili. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

Also known as Malnigal; daughter of Burnaburias II of Babylonia (Bryce 1997, p. 173). ‘Great priest’ in Kizzuwadna and king (lugal) of Aleppo (Bryce 1997, p. 174). After Šuppiluliuma concluded a treaty with Shattiwaza, son of King Tushratta of Mitanni, and married one of his daughters to him, Piyassili led a Hittite army that put Shattiwaza on the throne of Hanigalbat. A daughter married into the royal family of Babylon. Massanauzzi married Masturi, king of the Seha River Land (Bryce 1997, p. 313). After it had been quelled, Piyassili's son was made king of Carchemish by his uncle Muršili II. King and then Great King of Carchemish (Bryce 1997, pp. Bryce (1997) does not consider it clear whether Tudhaliya I/II was one king or two (p. 133). Puduhepa was the daughter of the Kizzuwadnan priest Pentipsarri (Bryce 1997, p. 273). Dashed lines indicate adoption. Last documented Great King of the Land of Hatti. The existence of Hattusili II is doubtful (Bryce 1997, pp. Tudhaliya IV probably married a Babylonian princess, known by her title of Great Princess (dumu.sal gal) (Bryce 1997, pp. Piyassili then returned to Carchemish. King (lugal) of Tarhuntassa (Bryce 1997, p. 296); apparently later Great King of Hatti (Bryce 1997, p. 354). Nerikkaili married a daughter of Bentesina, king of Amurru (Bryce 1997, p. 294). The people were deported and Šuppiluliuma made Piyassili governor of that town as well. "And all of the cities of the land of Carchemish, Murmurik, Shipri, Mazuwati and Šurun – these fortified cities– I gave to my son.

I'd be remiss if I forgot Ishtup-Ishar. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

In a letter written by the later Mariote king Enna-Dagan, Ishar is attested conquering and destroying the Eblaite cities of Lalanium and Emar. The king's name was traditionally read as Išhtup-šar, with šar being a common divine element in personal names attested in the region.

Well, of all the kings, we should mention Cotys I . I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

Cotys had successfully retained his kingdom. By 360 BC, Cotys controlled the whole Chersonese peninsula. In 361 BC, Charidemus returned to Athens with a treaty from Cotys, proclaiming him an ally. Following the revolt by Ariobarzanes against the Persian king Artaxerxes II, in 365 BC, Cotys opposed him and Ariobarzanes' ally, Athens. On gaining the Odrysian kingdom the Athenians made him their ally. Several Athenian generals in succession fought unsuccessfully against him and his mercenary commander Charidemus. Thought previously to be advisers to the King, they murdered him during a feast in his palace, under the pretext that he had wronged their father. In order to make his position stronger Cotys married his daughter to the Athenian general Iphicrates who soon became the second person in command after the king. According to Demosthenes, Iphicrates, with the help of Charidemus, bribed the Athenian military and naval commanders to suppress the rebellion. According to Diodorus, the city was saved only after the intervention of the Athenian general, Chabrias, whose forces then garrisoned the city.

Who could forget Mallikarjuna (Shilahara dynasty). Now that was one mean king.

He may be referred to the period 1170–1195 CE. Historians Dasharatha Sharma and R. B. Singh theorize that Amrabhata was the chief commander of the campaign, while Someshvara was the subordinate general who actually killed Mallikarjuna. This king is identified with Mallikarjuna, and his death can be dated to sometime between 1160 and 1162 CE. In one of them Aparaditya Is mentioned with the imperial titles Maharajadhiraja and Konkana-Chakravarti, which show that he had thrown off the yoke of the Chaulukyas of Gujarat.

Who could forget Mona Rai. Now that was one mean king.

Rai was subsequently killed in the final battle of Gour. Govinda was shocked after hearing of this news and fled with his family and the area came under the rule of Wazir Sikandar Khan Ghazi. Govinda appointed Rai as his chief minister, replacing the previous King Govardhan's former chief minister Madan Rai. Gorduar, which remains as ruins today, had seven floors; the second floor was also given to Mona Rai. It is located next to the dargah of Shah Jalal. During the British Raj, a 0.9 mile by-road was used connecting Sylhet with the hill. It was situated in a hillock near the port for ease in tax collection and civil duties. Govinda built a brick tower in Penchagor named Gorduar, which would serve as his palace and central administration.

If we're thinking of kings, let's include Yazid ibn Abi Muslim. Now that was one mean king.

Ibn Khallikan (p. 202) asserts that the Berber guard was pardoned by Caliph Yazid II, upon receipt of the report of Yazid's abusive administration in Ifriqiya. Yazid II appointed Bishr ibn Safwan al-Kalbi as the new governor in late 721. The Berber guard decided that enough was enough, and killed Yazid ibn Abi Muslim. During the illnesses that plagued al-Hajjaj's health before his death in 714, Yazid ibn Abi Muslim frequently stood in as his deputy. He rose in the ranks to become al-Hajjaj's secretary. According to the chronicler Ibn Abd-el-Hakem, in 721, Yazid ibn Abi Muslim decided to humiliate the Berber guard of Kairouan by having their hands tattooed - - their personal names on their right hand, and the phrase "Guard of Yazid" on their left. Yazid ibn Abi Muslim was of the Arab tribe of Thaqif. Abu'l-Ala Yazid ibn Abi Muslim Dinar (Arabic: يزيد بن أبي مسلم الثقفي‎) (?-721) was the Umayyad governor of Ifriqiya from 720 until his assassination in 721. His predecessor in Kairouan, Ismail ibn Abd Allah ibn Abu al-Muhajjar had put much effort into integrating Muslim Berbers into the Caliphal mainstream. Yazid ibn Abi Muslim's tenure in Ifriqiya was not a happy one.

In many ways, we're really talking about Labarna I. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

Retrieved 2010-05-16.CS1 maint: archived copy as title (link) "On the Origin of the Royal Title tabarna / labarna". Tabarna, a variant of Labarna,  is mentioned often in Hattian, Hittite, Hurrian and Akkadian texts from the Hittite archives. Given the relatively few contemporaneous references to Labarna I personally, some scholars have suggested that pioneering Hittitologists may have erred in assuming that Labarna was the personal name of a king. Upon PU-Sarruma's death, Labarna and Papahdilmah, one of PU-Sarruma's sons, contended for the throne, with Labarna emerging victorious. PU-Sarruma designated Labarna as his successor after his own sons revolted against him. Archived from the original on 2010-05-16. What little is known about him is culled mainly from the Telepinu Proclamation, which states that he overwhelmed his enemies and "made them borders of the sea", a statement which may refer to conquests as far as the Mediterranean coast in the south, and the Black Sea in the north.

I've heard about Maga of Characene. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

However, the historicity of Abinergaios III is open to question, as he known only from latter Arabic sources and Maga is the last ruler of Characene who is documented by contemporary sources. Although the level of Hellenisation in Charax had diminished since its conquest by Trajan a century earlier, it is still true that Alexander's last foundation was also the last point of his dreamed union of east and west. Characene was the last rump state of the Seleucid Empire. He is known only from the coins of his son of Maga, who calls himself son of King Attambelos. The reading of the name is, however, uncertain and reflects the poor quality of the coins of this time in general. Maga, therefore, comes as the last recorded successor of Alexander the Great and the end of his rule marks the terminus of the Hellenistic Age. It should also be noted that the king list of Characene is a modern construct and given the known sparsity of records could well be inaccurate.

How about that Cyrus I. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

His name in Modern Persian is کوروش, Kurosh, while in Greek he was called Κῦρος, Kȳros. Cyrus I Achaemenid dynastyBorn:  ? This is due to his suggested, but still debated identification, with the monarch known as "Kuras of Parsumas". In 612 BC the two managed to capture the Assyrian capital Nineveh. The latter would have then reigned in the early 6th century BC and his reign would seem rather uneventful. His elder son "Arukku"  was reportedly sent to Assyria to pay tribute to its King. Media and Babylon soon shared the lands previously controlled by the Assyrians. Cyrus is considered to have ended his days under the overlordship of either Cyaxares or his son Astyages (584–550 BC). Teispes' sons reportedly divided the kingdom between them after his death. This would place his fathering of Cambyses very late in life and his death at an advanced age. Kuras then seems to vanish from the historical record. His grandson would come to be known as Cyrus the Great, founder of the Persian Empire. Cyrus is mentioned being in a military alliance with the former. Cyrus reigned as king of Anshan while his brother Ariaramnes was king of Parsa. Cyrus I of Anshan is the grandfather of Cyrus the Great, also known as Cyrus II. Anshan apparently fell under the control of the former. Kuras is first mentioned c. 652 BC. Cyrus was succeeded by his son Cambyses I. The chronological placement of this event is uncertain. This was effectively the end of the Neo-Assyrian Empire though remnants of the Assyrian Army under Ashur-uballit II (612–609 BC) continued to resist from Harran.

Those of you up on your history know Sanesan. Now that was one mean king.

During the reign of his kinsman Khosrov III the Small, he invaded Armenia with an army of various peoples including Huns and Alans in 337. Sanesan's people, the Mazk'kut'k, have variously been identified as the Massagetae or as the Meskheti. This article relies largely or entirely on a single source. Grigoris was trampled to death by mounted Maskut soldiers in the Vatnik Valley, near the present-day village of Nughdi 37 south of Derbent.

Of course, there's Hedju Hor. Pretty nice as far as kings go.

Hedju-Hor has no known tomb and is not found in the text of the Palermo Stone, the oldest known king list, further making the claims of both Helck and van den Brink unlikely. Almost nothing is known of his rule, as he is known only from inscriptions found in the Delta region and pottery shards from Tura. It has been variously conjectured he was possibly the first pharaoh of Lower Egypt, or the last or that he was a member of Dynasty 0. The name Hedhu-Hor means The maces of Horus. It is thought by some that his rule was around 3250 BC, but though accurate details of his rule are currently unavailable, but the available ruler is around 3250 BC due to his rule being in prehistory.

Let's consider Leizu. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

While she was sipping a cup, she dropped a cocoon into the steaming water. "Tracing a Chinese Legend: In Search of the Identity of the 'First Sericulturalist.'" When the silk ran out, she saw a small cocoon and realized that this cocoon was the source of the silk. She is a popular object of worship in modern China, with the title of 'Silkworm Mother' (Can Nainai). Leizu found that she could unwind this soft and lovely thread around her finger. She persuaded her husband to give her a grove of mulberry trees, where she could domesticate the worms that made these cocoons. Leizu had a son named Changyi with the Yellow Emperor, and he was the father of Emperor Zhuanxu. She is attributed with inventing the silk reel, which joins fine filaments into a thread strong enough for weaving. Leizu shared her discoveries with others, and the knowledge became widespread in China. She is also credited with inventing the first silk loom. It is not known how much, if any, of this story is true, but historians do know that China was the first civilization to use silk.

Although the level of Hellenisation in Charax had diminished since its conquest by Trajan a century earlier, it is still true that Alexander's last foundation was also the last point of his dreamed union of east and west. He is known only from the coins of his son of Maga, who calls himself son of King Attambelos. On these coins, he describes himself as son of a King Attambelos who is otherwise unrecorded in history. It should also be noted that the king list of Characene is a modern construct and given the known sparsity of records could well be inaccurate.

In many ways, we're really talking about Guarionex. Was known to have a pretty regular mean streak.

He was the son of cacique Guacanagarix, the great Taíno prophet who had the vision of the coming of the Guamikena (White Men). Guarionex then opted for accommodation and appeasement but by 1497 the situation had deteriorated further. Guarionex then sided with Spanish rebel Francisco Roldán and set out to attack the Spaniards. Lost was a fortune in gold said by Bartolomé de las Casas to be worth 3600 castilians. The Spaniards captured him there and sent him in chains to Spain in 1502, but the ship sank during a storm. In 1495, Taino led by Caonabo raised up in arms but were crushed by Bartholomew Columbus.

Years ago, I read about Moctezuma I. Now that was one mean king.

As the two regions were added to Moctezuma's empire, the Aztecs relied on already established city-states to increase military power. The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. The Codex Mendoza records that the tribute owed by Coixtlahuaca consisted of 2000 blankets (of 5 types), 2 military outfits with headdresses and shields, green gemstone beads, 800 bunches of green feathers, 40 bags of cochineal dye, and 20 bowls of gold dust. He stole three of them from his dead brother Zaca. Under Itzcoatl, Moctezuma and Tlacaelel were generals in his army. His coronation was a large ceremony, involving many human sacrifices of prisoners. Often mistaken for his popular descendant, Moctezuma II, Moctezuma I greatly contributed to the famed Aztec Empire that thrived until Spanish arrival, and he ruled over a period of peace from 1440 to 1453. Similar campaigns were conducted against Cosamaloapan, Ahuilizapan (Orizaba), and Cuetlachtlan (Cotaxtla). These droughts and frosts continued for four years. The newly adopted water source provided an ample supply of fresh water to Texcoco's various communities, which extended over a distance of 12-kilometers from their lakeshore to the hills of Tetxcotxinco. In 1446, a swarm of locusts destroyed the region's crops In 1449, Lake Texcoco flooded the city. Early in his rule, he led a conquest against the state of Oaxaca in 1445. In this video game, Moctezuma is the leader of one the playable civilizations which are competing to have a successful empire. He enacted codes, which determined what people of certain classes could wear and what their houses could look like. In game, the civilization is known for aggression and expansion. Expeditions as ruler In about 1458, Moctezuma led an expedition into Mixtec territory against the city-state of Coixtlahuaca, the pretext being the mistreatment of Aztec merchants. While most of the defeated chieftains were allowed to retain their positions, the Mixtec ruler Atonal was ritually strangled and his family was taken as slaves. Moctezuma brought social, economical, and political reform to strengthen Aztec rule, and Tenochititlan benefited from relations with other tribes. "Portrait: Montezuma I sitting for his portrait carved in the rock at Chapultepec". Believing the famine to have occurred due to their gods' anger, Moctezuma supported the order for an increase of human sacrifices to please them. In the palace, different classes were to be received in different rooms. If the last declaration was not accepted by the enemy region, then within 20 days the Aztecs would attack. His name meant “he is angry like a lord” (from the root “tēuc-”  combined with the reflexive verb “mo/zōma” ). During his reign, Moctezuma and his brother Tlacaelel I lead an opposition group of young nobles. He also created legal and education policies that were determined by class. He was the grandson of the first ruler of Tenochtitlan. During his reign, the Aztec Empire was consolidated, major expansion was undertaken, and Tenochtitlan started becoming the dominant partner of the Aztec Triple Alliance. Among the Aztecs' greatest achievements, Moctezuma and Nezahualcoyotl of Texcoco organized the construction and completion of a double aqueduct pipe system, supplying the city of Tenochtitlan with fresh water. The war lasted until Spanish Conquest in Mexico, where Spaniards recruited enemy tribes of the Triple Alliance to conquer all of Mexico. He was a brother of Chimalpopoca, Tlacaelel I, and Huehue Zaca. He held the title of "Great Speaker". His crown was a turquoise diadem known as the fire crown. In Science and Its Times, edited by Neil Schlager and Josh Lauer, 89-90. However, other historians report that he was once given the opportunity to rule and turned the opportunity down.

Years ago, I read about Aga of Kish. Now that was one mean king.

Since Gilgamesh addresses Aga denoting military relations between them in the past and indebtedness to him for saving his life leads to Gilgamesh being dependent on Aga previously, conflicting with the assumption that he won a previous war against Kish. Mesopotamia: Civilization Begins. Birhurtura denies, replying that when their true king appears his army will be beaten to dust and him captured, this angers Aga, who continues to torture him. The response of the guruš is mitigated by the fact that they don't talk about the king itself, but about the "son of the king"; suggesting that Aga is still young and immature. Gilgamesh addresses Aga as his superior, remembering how Aga saved his life and gave him refuge, Aga withdraws his demand and begs his favor to be returned. Archeology evidence from Kish shows a city flourishing in ED II with its political influence extending beyond the territory, however in ED III the city declined rapidly. c.Lugal is Gilgamesh title in wartime, while his official title is En of Kulaba (Uruk). His reign probably took over Umma, and consequently Zabala, which was a dependant of it in the Early Dynastic Period; this can be supported on his appearance the Gem of King Aga, where he is mentioned as the king of Umma. Gilgamesh repeats the message before the "city fathers" (ab-ba-iri) to suggest rebelling against Aga, however, his proposition is rejected. The name in question is to be interpreted as a Sumerian genitival phrase, Akka probably means "Made by " (ak + Divine Name.ak). Another theory is since Enmebaragesi established the hegemony of Kish, defeating Aga would be less impressive than his powerful father, who therefore served the purpose of the hymn and portrays Gilgamesh as a mighty figure. The gem has four columns of text on its faces, and reads "For Inanna, Aga King of Umma" (𒀭𒈹𒀝𒈗𒄑𒆵𒆠, dinanna ak lugal ummaki). Gilgamesh asks for a volunteer to stand before Aga, his royal guard Birhurtura offers himself. Then Gilgamesh leans to the wall; his divine radiance doesn't frighten Aga but is beheld by the Kishite army. Aga's name has appeared in the Stele of Ushumgal and the Gem of King Aga, both showing influence over Umma. On leaving the city gates, he is captured and brought before Aga himself, who interrogates and tortures him.

If we're thinking of kings, let's include Damnazes. Was known to have a pretty regular mean streak.

Sources Martindale, John Robert; Jones, Arnold Hugh Martin; Morris, J., eds. Damnazes is known to the Byzantine historian John Malalas as the father and predecessor of Tzathius, king of the Lazi. On his death, his son and successor, Tzathius, rejected an Iranian coronation and repaired to Constantinople to have his accession validated by the Byzantine emperor Justin I.

How about that Nimaathap. Mean? I'm not so sure.

However these theories are now disproven by the large number of seal impressions (and a few stone bowl inscriptions) bearing Nimaathap's titles "mother of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt", "mother of royal children" and "king's wife". This is similar to the name of queen Khenthap of the 1st Dynasty. This is based on the fact that most of her seals were found in the tomb of Khasekhemwy at Abydos. Metjen was "overseer of the Ka-house of Nimaethap"; thus he oversaw and administered the mortuary cult for the queen. An old reading once was Hepenmaat, because the syllable Hapi was not recognized as the name of Hapy yet. This would have fit with the Ramesside king lists, which let the 3rd dynasty begin with king Nebka. It is unknown how many children Nimaathap had. Nimaathap may have acted as regent for her son Djoser. Scholars are now also convinced that Djoser was indeed a founder of a new dynasty because Djoser and Nimaathap buried Khasekhemwy at the Thinite cemetery of Abydos, but Djoser founded a new Memphite cemetery at Saqqara. Nimaathap's name also appears in a tomb inscription of the high official Metjen, who held office under the kings Huni and Sneferu. But then she was possibly buried somewhere at Abusir, because a high ranked official named Metjen was responsible for the mortuary cult around that queen. see Silke Roth: Die Königsmütter des Alten Ägypten von der Frühzeit bis zum Ende der 12. It is now believed that Nimaathap was a princess of the Northern royal house. Egyptologists take this as a proof of how famous Nimaathap must have been during the Old Kingdom period. Nimaathap's name does not appear in the pyramid necropolis of Djoser at Saqqara; there, her name was replaced by depictions of the god of grief and mummies, Anubis. This title appears on a granite mug, but the authenticity of the artifact is questioned by scholars. The relief is evaluated as proof that Nimaathap was still alive at that time and that she participated in at least one Hebsed ceremony. After this, Nimaathap possibly supported her son for a few years, as the relief fragment from Heliopolis may indicate.

I established their freedom from the border of the marshes and Ur and Nippur, Awal, and Kismar, Der of the god Ishtaran, as far as Assur. His son, Erishum I, is identified as the king who succeeded him and reigned for 30 years (or 40, depending on the copy of the Assyrian King List),[nb 1] followed by Ilu-shuma's other son, Ikunum. He titled himself "vice-regent of Assur, beloved of the god Ashur and the goddess Ishtar." Larsen has suggested that he may have been a contemporary of Iddin-Dagan and Ishme-Dagan of Isin, which would clash with the synchronization with Sumu-abum, but make more sense given the current chronology favored. c. 1900 BCPredecessorShalim-ahumSuccessorErishum IFatherShalim-ahum Ilu-shuma or Ilu-šūma, inscribed DINGIR-šum-ma,[i 1] son of Shalim-ahum:7–8 was the thirty-second king of Assyria, c. 1900 BC (short chronology.)

Well, of all the kings, we should mention Antiochus VII Sidetes. Now that was one mean king.

But a fragment from book 16 of Posidonius' "Histories", which survives in the Deipnosophistae written by Athenaeus, mentions a king named Seleucus, who was captured in Media by king Arsaces and treated like royalty. Appian, however, states that he did commit suicide. 164 / 160 BCDied129 BCEcbatana, Iran during the Battle of EcbatanaConsortCleopatra TheaIssueAntiochus IX CyzicenusAlexander II Zabinas (claimed)DynastySeleucid dynastyFatherDemetrius I SoterMotherpossibly Laodice V Antiochus VII Euergetes (Greek: Ἀντίοχος Ζ΄ Ευεργέτης) (c. 164/160 BC – 129 BC), nicknamed Sidetes (Greek: Σιδήτης) (from Side, a city in Asia Minor), also known as Antiochus the Pious, was ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire who reigned from July/August 138 to 129 BC. The Seleucid king and army spent the winter feasting, hunting and drinking (the Seleucids maintained the Macedonian tradition of heavy drinking). ]]; see its history for attribution. In a barren valley, he was ambushed and killed in the Battle of Ecbatana by Phraates II and a large force of Parthians, who had entered the country without being detected. Later territory disputes and defeat  Jerusalem besieged by Antiochus Sidetes. The identity of this Seleucus have been a matter of debate; the possibility of Seleucus being a son of Antiochus VII captured after the death of his father is suggested by Felix Jacoby and, with reservations, by Ian G. That winter (130–129 BC), several Median towns rose in rebellion and attacked their Seleucid garrisons. Nevertheless, King Antiochus' respectful treatment of the Jews, and respect for their religion, earned him their gratitude and added name Euergetes ("the Benefactor").

Hoping to further sow dissension amongst his foes, Phraates also released his long-held prisoner, Demetrius II, Antiochus' older brother, who returned to Syria to reclaim the throne.

You should also add the template {{Translated|de|Antiochos VII.}} The new Parthian ruler, Phraates II, had not been idle. Antiochus marched to support one such isolated garrison with only a small force (probably only his Royal Guards). He restored Mesopotamia, Babylonia and Media to the Seleucid empire, before dispersing his army into winter quarters. During the siege he allowed a seven-day truce for the Jews to celebrate a religious festival, impressing the Jewish leadership.

Let's consider House of Suhi. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

None of his own inscriptions have survived, but he is mentioned in the inscriptions of his successors and in an inscription of a son named Arnu-..., who was a priest of the goddess Kubaba. He married his daughter to a king named Tudhaliya who surely was not identical with Tudhaliya, great king of Carchemish who was thought to have reigned in the late 11th or early 10th century BC. It is known that Suhi II made military operations. During his reign, Katuwa had to fight with the "grandsons" (descendants) of Uratarhunza. Suhi II was married to a woman named BONUS-ti and he was the father of his successor Katuwa. Those descendants of the last Great King of Carchemish seemingly searched to rule Carchemish, so Katuwa reacted against those ambitions. Bearing the title of ruler, he probably ruled in the early 10th century BC. The members of this dynasty are best known to us through Hieroglyphic Luwian sources. The House of Suhi was followed by a dynasty known as the House of Astiruwa. ISBN 978-1-58983-269-5 Gwendolyn Leick: Who's Who in the Ancient Near East. Only one member of the house of Suhi is specifically mentioned in Assyrian sources.

I recall Amyrtaeus. Now that was one mean king.

If the information was correct, Amyrtaeus would seem to have acted in this way to ingratiate himself with Artaxerxes II. He ended the first Persian occupation of Egypt (i.e. Nepherites I then transferred the capital to Mendes (Lower Egypt). A "virtually unknown ruler", he is not known to have left any monuments, and his name in Egyptian is only reconstructed from demotic notices: no hieroglyphic writing of his names has been found. J.-C., Transeuphratène 9, Leuven: Peeters Publishers. Dizionario delle Dinastie Faraoniche. the Twenty-seventh Dynasty: 525–404 BC) and reigned from 404 BC to 399 BC. Nepherites I reigned until 393 BC, being succeeded by his designated heir, his son Hakor. In 1st century BC, the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote in his Bibliotheca historica (XIV, 35.3–5) that a King named Psamtik — which seems to be identified with Amyrtaeus, perhaps being "Psamtik" his lost regnal name  — murdered the Greek admiral Tamos who had taken refuge in Egypt after the defeat of the rebel Cyrus. According to Isocrates, Artaxerxes II assembled an army in Phoenicia under the command of Abrocomas to retake Egypt shortly after coming to the Persian throne, but political problems with his brother Cyrus the Younger prevented this from taking place, allowing the Egyptians sufficient time to throw off Achaemenid rule.

Layth is first mentioned as commanding an army against the king of Farghana under al-Masnur, while al-Mahdi sent him against the Iranian rebel al-Muqanna. Layth and his brother were purchased as slaves by al-Mansur and given to his heir al-Mahdi (r. 775–785), who set them free. He was recalled during the brief reign of al-Hadi (r. 785–786), but reinstated to the post by Harun al-Rashid (r.

I'd be remiss if I forgot Artaxerxes I of Persia. Was known to have a pretty regular mean streak.

So, they clearly were contemporaries working together in Jerusalem at the time the wall and the city of Jerusalem was rebuilt in contrast to the previously stated viewpoint. Plutarch, Artaxerxes, l. 1. c. 1. Also, Artaxerxes I gave him Magnesia, Myus, and Lampsacus to maintain him in bread, meat, and wine. This funding practice inevitably prompted renewed fighting in 450 BC, where the Greeks attacked at the Battle of Cyprus. Therefore, the more informative Old Testament examples of civil government were "good" non-covenant kings such as Artaxerxes, who tolerated the Jews and did not insist that they follow his state religion. They arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month of the seventh year according to the Hebrew calendar. This assumption would imply that the biblical account is not chronological. Williams published The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience, arguing for a separation of church and state based on biblical reasoning. Artaxerxes I offered asylum to Themistocles, who was probably his father Xerxes's greatest enemy for his victory at the Battle of Salamis, after Themistocles was ostracized from Athens. In addition, Artaxerxes I gave him Skepsis to provide him with clothes, and he also gave him Percote with bedding for his house. 11:129 - cited by Ussher, Annals, para. After Cimon's failure to attain much in this expedition, the Peace of Callias was agreed among Athens, Argos and Persia in 449 BC. According to Ctesias (in Persica 20), Artabanus then accused Crown Prince Darius, Xerxes's eldest son, of the murder, and persuaded Artaxerxes to avenge the patricide by killing Darius. But according to Aristotle (in Politics 5.1311b), Artabanus killed Darius first and then killed Xerxes. This indirectly caused the Athenians to move the treasury of the Delian League from the island of Delos to the Athenian acropolis. The vase is now in the Reza Abbasi Museum in Teheran (inv. Themistocles would go on to learn and adopt Persian customs, Persian language, and traditions. However, Ezra appears for the first time in Nehemiah 8, having probably been at the court for twelve years. Ezra thereby left Babylon in the first month of the seventh year  of Artaxerxes' reign, at the head of a company of Jews that included priests and Levites. In Artaxerxes' twentieth year, Nehemiah, the king's cup-bearer, apparently was also a friend of the king as in that year Artaxerxes inquired after Nehemiah's sadness. Most scholars hold that Ezra lived during the rule of Artaxerxes I, though some have difficulties with this assumption: Nehemiah and Ezra "seem to have no knowledge of each other; their missions do not overlap", however, in Nehemiah 12, both are leading processions on the wall as part of the wall dedication ceremony. In 460 BC, Inaros II revolted against the Persians with the help of his Athenian allies, and defeated the Persian army commanded by satrap Akheimenes.

I've heard about Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

"This Haunting Mask Could Be The Face of The Longest-Reigning Ancient Maya King". His skeletal remains were still lying in his coffin, wearing a jade mask and bead necklaces, surrounded by sculptures and stucco reliefs depicting the ruler's transition to divinity and figures from Maya mythology. However, although his grandfather was a personage of ajaw ranking, he does not himself appear to have been a king. Houses B and C were built in 661 and house A in 668. He was succeeded by his son, Kʼinich Kan Bahlam II. Santa Elena became a tributary of Palenque. Interpretation of the lid has raised controversy. House A is covered with frescos of prisoners captured in 662. The large carved stone sarcophagus lid in the Temple of Inscriptions is a unique piece of Classic Maya art. Iconographically, however, it is closely related to the large wall panels of the temples of the Cross and the Foliated Cross centered on world trees. Having been appointed ajaw at the age of twelve, Pakal's mother was a regent to him. Maya rulership titles and name glyphs themselves do not use regnal numbers, they are a convenience only of modern scholars. Pakal ascended the throne at age 12 and lived to the age of 80. Confusingly, he has at times been referred to as either "Pakal I" or "Pakal II". Reference to him as Pakal II alludes to his maternal grandfather (who died c.612) also being named Janahb Pakal. During a reign of 68 years—the fifth-longest verified regnal period of any sovereign monarch in history, the longest in world history for more than a millennium,[N 2] and still the second longest in the history of the Americas[N 3]—Pakal was responsible for the construction or extension of some of Palenque's most notable surviving inscriptions and monumental architecture. The king himself wears the attributes of the Tonsured maize god - in particular a turtle ornament on the breast - and is shown in a peculiar posture that may denote rebirth. Some contest that the glyphs refer to two people with the same name or that an unusual method for recording time was used, but other experts in the field say that allowing for such possibilities would go against everything else that is known about the Maya calendar and records of events. These are the dates indicated on the Maya inscriptions in Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. Both the king and the serpent head on which he seems to rest are framed by the open jaws of a funerary serpent, a common iconographic device for signalling entrance into, or residence in, the realm(s) of the dead. For other uses, see Pakal (disambiguation). Later on, a mask of Pakal was discovered in August 2018. Whether the bones in the tomb are really those of Pakal is under debate because analysis of the wear on the skeleton's teeth places the age of the owner at death as 40 years younger than Pakal would have been at his death. In 626 Pakal married Ix Tzʼakbu Ajaw who was born in Uxteʼkʼuh. The central image is that of a cruciform world tree. In 663 Pakal killed another lord of Pipaʼ. Over the years she slowly ceded power until she died in September 640. Von Däniken reproduced a drawing of the sarcophagus lid, incorrectly labeling it as being from "Copán" and comparing Pacal's pose to that of Project Mercury astronauts in the 1960s. Pakal started his construction by adding monument rooms onto the old level of the building. In 647 Kʼinich Janaab Pakal began his first construction project (he was 44 at the time). Six days later Nuun Ujol Chaak, ajaw of Santa Elena, was captured and taken to Palenque. The building was already in existence, but Pakal made it much larger than it was. He has a mask on his nose, he uses his two hands to manipulate some controls, and the heel of his left foot is on a kind of pedal with different adjustments. Traces of pigment show that these were once colorfully painted, common of much Maya sculpture at the time. Before his name was securely deciphered from extant Maya inscriptions, this ruler had been known by an assortment of nicknames and approximations, including Pakal or Pacal, Sun Shield, 8 Ahau, and (familiarly) as Pacal the Great. Epigraphers insist that the inscriptions on the tomb indicate that it is indeed Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal entombed within, and that he died at the age of 80 after ruling for around 70 years. : Unsolved Mysteries of the Past. The most commonly accepted explanation for the irregularity is that Pakal, being an aristocrat, had access to softer, less abrasive food than the average person so that his teeth naturally acquired less wear.

In many ways, we're really talking about Mentuhotep II. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

Surviving relief fragments show the deified king surrounded by the chief deities of Upper and Lower Egypt, Nekhbet, Seth, Horus and Wadjet, and on a par with them. This is evidenced by the dominant artistic style of the temple which represents people with large lips and eyes and thin bodies. This was still the case during the late 12th Dynasty some 200 years later: Senusret III and Amenemhat III erected stelae commemorating opening of the mouth ceremonies practiced on Mentuhotep II's statues. Thus it was only in 1859, that Lord Dufferin and his assistants, Dr. Lorange and Cyril C. Graham, started to excavate the southwest corner of the hypostyle hall of Mentuhotep's temple. In particular, the statue of Amun was brought annually to Deir el-Bahri during the Beautiful Festival of the Valley, something which the king may have perceived as beneficial to this funerary cult. Der Tempel des Königs Mentuhotep von Deir el-Bahari. His mortuary temple was one of Mentuhotep II’s most ambitious building projects, and included several architectural and religious innovations. In the meantime, Mentuhotep II started an extensive program of self-deification emphasizing the divine nature of the ruler. His temple inspired several later temples, such as those of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The causeway led to a large courtyard in front of the Deir el-Bahri temple. Following the reunification, Mentuhotep II was considered by his subjects to be divine, or half divine. Many Egyptologists have long considered two rock reliefs, showing Mentuhotep II towering over smaller figures labeled king "Intef", to be conclusive evidence that his predecessor Intef III was his own father; this is, however, not entirely certain, as these reliefs may have had other propagandistic purposes, and there are other difficulties surrounding Mentuhotep's true origin, his three name-changes, and his frequent attempts to claim descent from various gods. As such, Mentuhotep II's temple was certainly a major source of inspiration for the nearby, but 550-year later temples of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III. The eastern front part of the temple, on both sides of the rising ramp, consists of two porticos with a double row of rectangular pillars, which make the temple look like a saff tomb, the traditional burial of Mentuhotep II's 11th-Dynasty predecessors. Egypt was not unified during this time, and the Tenth Dynasty, rival to Mentuhotep’s Eleventh, ruled Lower Egypt from Herakleopolis. Neferu II ("The beautiful") was called "King's wife" and ḥmt-nswt-mryt.f, "King's wife, his beloved". Early reign When he ascended the Theban throne, Mentuhotep II inherited the vast land conquered by his predecessors from the first cataract in the south to Abydos and Tjebu in the north. The courtyard of the ambulatory was completely filled by the core building, a massive 22 m large and 11 m high construction. More precisely, this second change may have taken place on the occasion of the sed festival celebrated during his 39th year on the throne. He reigned for 51 years, according to the Turin King List. Reunification of Egypt In the 14th year of his reign, an uprising occurred in the north. Mentuhotep II changed his titulary twice during his reign: the first time in his 14th regnal year, marking the initial successes of his campaign against Herakleopolis Magna to the north. Seated statues of Mentuhotep II next to the causeway Left and right of the processional walkway were at least 22 seated statues of Mentuhotep II wearing, on the south side, the White Crown of Upper Egypt and on the north side the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. Mentuhotep also relied on a mobile force of royal court officials who further controlled the deeds of the nomarchs. The ramp that is visible today was constructed in 1905 by Édouard Naville over the remains of the original ramp, which only is visible in two places as the lowest two layers of the lateral limestone cladding. Mentuhotep II receives offering, Musée du Louvre. Indeed, the decoration and royal statuary of the temple emphasizes the Osirian aspects of the dead ruler, an ideology apparent in the funerary statuary of many later pharaohs. The exact date when reunification was achieved is not known, but it is assumed to have happened shortly before year 39 of his reign. The parentage of Mentuhotep II is also indirectly confirmed by a relief at Shatt er-Rigal. On the west end of the hypostyle hall lies the holiest place of the temple, a sanctuary dedicated to Mentuhotep and Amun-Ra leading to a small speos which housed a larger-than-life statue of the king. About ten years later, between 1920 and 1931, Herbert E. Winlock further excavated the temple for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At the center of the open courtyard lies a deep dromos leading to the royal tomb. In particular he adopted the complete five-fold titulary after his reunification of Egypt, seemingly for the first time since the 6th Dynasty, though known records are sparse for much of the First Intermediate Period that preceded him. Her tomb was discovered in 1859 by Lord Dufferin and fully excavated in 1968 by D. Reign Mentuhotep II is considered to be the first ruler of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. Rear part of the temple Behind the core edifice was the center of the cult for the deified king. Indeed, evidence shows that the process took time, maybe due to the general insecurity of the country at the time: commoners were buried with weapons, the funerary stelae of officials show them holding weapons instead of the usual regalia and when Mentuhotep II's successor sent an expedition to Punt some 20 years after the reunification, they still had to clear the Wadi Hammamat of rebels. Apparently she died after her husband and was buried by her son in Mentuhotep's temple. However, the most profound innovations of Mentuhotep II's temple are not architectural but religious. This certainly refers to the conquest of the Thinite region by the Herakleopolitan kings who apparently desecrated the sacred ancient royal necropolis of Abydos in the process. He published his results in three volumes. Some headless sandstone statues are still on site today. Other important officials were the treasurer Meketre and the overseer of sealers Meru. Henhenet might have died in childbirth. After the unification of Egypt however, Mentuhotep II initiated a strong policy of centralization, reinforcing his royal authority by creating the posts of Governor of Upper Egypt and Governor of Lower Egypt who had power over the local nomarchs. It has been suggested that she was Nubian. In fact, the general scarcity of testimonies from the early part of Mentuhotep's reign might indicate that he was young when he ascended the throne, a hypothesis consistent with his 51 years long reign. She bore the titles of ḥmt-nswt mryt.f "King's wife, his beloved" and ẖkrt-nswt, "King's embellishment". For most of these columns, only the base is still visible today. D. Arnold: Der Tempel des Königs Mentuhotep in Deir el-Bahari. It is most likely one of his daughters. Mentuhotep II subsequently dispatched his armies to the north. Mentuhotep II was buried at the Theban necropolis of Deir el-Bahri. This phenomenon of fragmentation of the artistic styles is observed throughout the First Intermediate Period and is a direct consequence of the political fragmentation of the country. Instead, he proposed that the edifice was flat-roofed. The valley temple was linked to the high temple by a 1.2 km long and 46 m wide uncovered causeway. Further excavations of the pits undertaken in 1970 by Dieter Arnold revealed more food offerings such as bread and beef ribs, but also some bronze objects, a faience scepter and sheets of fabric. At the opposite, the refined chapels of Mentuhotep II's wives are certainly due to Memphite craftsmen who were heavily influenced by the standards and conventions of the Old Kingdom. Realising the potential of the site, they then gradually worked their way to the sanctuary, where they found the granite altar of Mentuhotep with a representation of Amun-Re and various other finds such as the grave of Neferu TT319. She might have been Mentuhotep II's sister since she also bore the titles of sȝt-nswt-šmswt-nt-ẖt.f, "Eldest king daughter of his body", jrjt-pˁt, "hereditary princess" and ḥmwt-nbwt, "mistress of all women". Note that an alternative theory holds that Henhenet was one of Intef III's secondary wives, possibly the mother of Neferu II. The front part of the temple is dedicated to Monthu-Ra, a merger of the sun god Ra with the Theban god of war Monthu, particularly worshipped during the 11th Dynasty. For example, it included terraces and covered walkways around the central structure, and it was the first mortuary temple that identified the pharaoh with the god Osiris. The Turin Canon credits him with a reign of 51 years. Mwyt, a five year-old girl buried with Mentuhotep II's secondary wives. The many architectural innovations of the temple mark a break with the Old Kingdom tradition of pyramid complexes and foreshadow the Temples of Millions of Years of the New Kingdom. The presence of a pyramid is debated. The sheets were marked in red ink at the corner, seven with the name of Mentuhotep II and three with that of Intef II. However, his results were published only in the form of preliminary reports in summary form. Finally, in 1898, Howard Carter discovered the Bab el-Hosan  cache in the front court, where he uncovered the famous black seated statue of the king. Mentuhotep II also created new governmental posts whose occupants were Theban men loyal to him, giving the pharaoh more control over his country. Indeed, when H. Winlock discovered them, they still contained many offerings: a cattle skull, pitchers and bowls filled with fruits, barley and bread and a mud brick bearing Mentuhotep II's name. Furthermore, Mentuhotep may have chosen Deir el-Bahri because it is aligned with the temple of Karnak, on the other side of Nile. Mentuhotep II's first fourteen years of reign seem to have been peaceful in the Theban region as there are no surviving traces of conflict firmly datable to that period. This chapel was once closed by a double door now missing. The open courtyard is flanked on the north and south sides by a row of five columns and on the east side by a double row totalling sixteen columns. Foundational offerings Under the four corners of the temple terrace, H. Winlock discovered four pits during his 1921–1922 excavations.

In the Book of Tobit, chapter 1, the exiled Tobit is shown finding favor in the court of "Enemessar", only to lose influence under Sennacherib. According to 2 Kings, chapters 17–18, Shalmaneser accused Hoshea, King of Israel, of conspiring against him by sending messages to Pharaoh Osorkon IV of Egypt,  and captured him. The name Shalmaneser is used for him in the Bible, which attributes to him the final conquest of the kingdom of Samaria (Israel) and the deportation of Israelites.

Of course, there's Neferkare (9th dynasty). I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

However, the inscription in question simply states "Horus brings/brought (or may Horus bring) a (good) inundation for his son Ka-nefer-Re." Uncertainty about the verb tense in the inscription has led to disagreement among various scholars as to whether this named pharaoh would have ruled in Ankhtifi's youth, or at the time of the events he describes, or indeed if it were not a king before Ankhtifi's time, who had ruled toward the end of the Old Kingdom from Memphis. Neferkare is not included on the Abydos King List or the Saqqara King List, nor can the existence of his reign be positively confirmed through archaeological finds. If Neferkare and Kaneferre were the same pharaoh, his authority is sometimes presumed from Ankhtifi's inscription to have extended at least over Elephantine, Edfu and Hieraconpolis, the capitals of the first three nomoi of Upper Egypt.

In many ways, we're really talking about Abdullah (Chagatai Khanate). Now that was one mean king.

The Barlas and Suldus tribes, both located near the city, hated the prospect of a strong Qara'unas presence in their immediate vicinity. After Qazaghan had taken control of the Chagatai ulus in around 1346, he appointed Abdullah as governor of Samarkand. Unlike his father, he had an active interest in the tribes of the northern part of the ulus. Abdullah (died c. 1359) was the leader of the Qara'unas (1358–1359) and the ruler of the Chagatai ulus (1358). Qazaghan, whose power base had been in the southern portion of the ulus, had tended to leave the northern tribes alone; Abdullah was not content to do the same. When the latter died in 1358 Abdullah succeeded him. The northern tribes bitterly resented his attempts to curtail their power.

After a battle at an unknown location, Utu-Hengal was victorious and forced Tirigan to flee back towards Gutium.

I recall Den . I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

It seems that Den sent troops to the Sinai Peninsula and the eastern desert a number of times. He also had numerous sons and daughters; his possible successors could have been king Anedjib and king Semerkhet. In one hand Den holds a mace, in the other hand he grabs a foe by his hair. At the left side the name of the high official Iny-Ka is inscribed. Some of these methods are said to originate from the reign of Den, but this statement may merely be trying to make the medical advice sound traditional and authoritative. Prior to this, important year events were merely depicted in signs and miniatures, sometimes guided by the hieroglyphic sign rnpt "bald palm panicle", meaning “year”. The Saqqara Tablet mysteriously omits Den completely. Twenty labels made of ivory and ebony were found in his tomb, 18 by Flinders Petrie in the spoil heaps left by the less thorough Émile Amélineau. Subsidiary tombs and palatial mastabas at Sakkara belonged to high officials such as Ipka, Ankh-ka, Hemaka, Nebitka, Amka, Iny-ka and Ka-Za. Den's Royal Household is also well researched. Den's mother was rewarded with her own tomb of royal dimensions and with her own mortuary cult. Queen Neithhotep may have taken on a similar role before Meritneith, while queens such as Sobekneferu and Hatshepsut were later female Egyptian rulers. Beginning According to archaeological records, at the very beginning of his reign, Den had to share the throne with his mother Meritneith for several years. The Turin King List refers to “Qenentj”, which is quite difficult to translate. Den is said to have brought prosperity to his realm and numerous innovations are attributed to his reign. 30th year: Appearance of the king of Lower- and Upper Egypt; 2nd celebration of the Hebsed. The birth name of Den was misread in Ramesside times. The middle right section reports about the raid of the city "beautiful door" and about a daughter of Den suffering from an unknown disease. The inscription shows the figure of a shaman with an undefined vessel or urn at his feet. Discovered in the tomb of Den, now in the Egyptian Museum. Tomb T is among the largest and most finely-built of the tombs in this area, and is the first to feature a staircase and a floor made of granite. This is in accord with the introduction of the Nisut-Bity-title by Den. He was the first to use the title "King of Lower and Upper Egypt", and the first depicted as wearing the double crown (red and white). It is possible the tomb was used as a storehouse for surplus produce during the king's lifetime, while also making it easier to add grave goods for later use in the afterlife by Den. The artifacts were found at Abydos, Saqqara and Abu Rawash. Den's wives were the queens Semat, Nakht-Neith and, possibly, Qaineit. The hieroglyphs at the right side say "first smiting of the east". Tomb T is also the first tomb to include architectural elements made of stone rather than mud-brick. Among these labels are the earliest known depictions of a pharaoh wearing the double-crown of Egypt (see above), as well as running between ritual stele as part of the Sed festival. Egyptologists such as Toby Wilkinson and Francesco Tiradritti think that the birth name refers to the eastern and the western desert – both surrounding Egypt like protective shields – or to Lower and Upper Egypt. 20th year: Creation of the Mafdet-fetish; raising of the Sentj-pillars. Den's family has been the subject of significant research. Mesopotamia: Civilization Begins. The floor of his tomb at Umm El Qa'ab near Abydos is made of red and black granite, the first time in Egypt this hard stone was used as a building material. During his long reign he established many of the customs of court ritual and royalty used by later rulers and he was held in high regard by his immediate successors. Den's serekh name was "Den" or "Dewen", most likely meaning "he who brings the water". Thanks to the braids and the conic beard the foe has been identified as of Asian origin. Thought to be the king's retainers, an examination of some of the skeletons suggests they were strangled, making this an example of human sacrifice which is considered to be common with the pharaohs of the First Dynasty. 22nd year: Visit to the royal domain of Semer-Netjeru; first celebration of the Hebsed. In a subsidiary tomb at Den's necropolis, the rare stela of a dwarf named Ser-Inpu was found.

Years ago, I read about Shattuara. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

A later king also called Shattuara is suggested to have ruled Hanigalbat during the reign of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser I (1263-1233 BC). Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. However, it seems more likely this event is a recapitulation of the revolt against Adad-nirari I, either by Shattuara or his son Wasashatta. In an Assyrian inscription, King Shattuara of Hanigalbat is said to have waged war against Shalmaneser I.

Who could forget Quintus Hortensius . Not the meanest as they come, but let's say they had more bad days than good.

Another law, passed about the same time, which declared the nundinae (market days) to be dies fasti (days on which legal business might be transacted), is also attributed to him. He is said to have died while still in office, thus making him (if true) one of two formal dictators to die in office in history, with the other being Julius Caesar. This was not a mere re-enactment of previous laws. This article includes a list of references, related reading or external links, but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations.

I'd be remiss if I forgot Maga of Characene. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

Characene was the last rump state of the Seleucid Empire. Maga, therefore, comes as the last recorded successor of Alexander the Great and the end of his rule marks the terminus of the Hellenistic Age. His coins are in a Parthian style, and the name on his coins is written in Aramaic as mʼg – which is interpreted as Maga. Ironically its demises came at the hands of a resurrected Persian Empire. It should also be noted that the king list of Characene is a modern construct and given the known sparsity of records could well be inaccurate. He is known only from the coins of his son of Maga, who calls himself son of King Attambelos. He probably ruled at the end of the second century (195-210AD) and is known only from numerous coins that he minted.

How about that Jie of Xia. Now that was one mean king.

In one speech Tang of Shang said that creating chaos is not something he wanted, but given the terror of Jie, he has to follow the mandate of heaven and use this opportunity to overthrow Xia. Another chancellor, Guan Longfeng (關龍逢), told the emperor that he was losing the trust of his people along with the Xia dynasty’s rivers and mountains (江山). Yi remained in the Xia capital for about three years, before returning to Shang. Several hundred people were employed just to supply Jie with his meals. In his 13th year of the ruling, he moved his capital from Zhenxun to Henan. Around 1600 BCE, Jie was defeated by Tang of Shang, bringing an end to the Xia Dynasty that lasted about 500 years, and a rise to the new Shang Dynasty. Vegetables had to come from the northwest, fish had to be from the East Sea, seasonings and sauces had to come from ginger that grew in the south, sea salt had to come from the north. Jie eventually died of illness. After a while the chancellor was tired to the point that he could no longer crawl or move. It is documented that Jie also saw the "money face" (脸钱) during this time but refused to share it among his people, leading to the downfall of the Xia dynasty. He is traditionally regarded as a tyrant and oppressor who brought about the collapse of a dynasty. After yelling at Guan, he too was dragged out to be killed. He lived there for three years and constructed his tilt palace. During Jie's reign, Shang grew in power, initially at the expense of Xia's other vassals. In the 26th year of Jie’s reign, Shang conquered Wen. She then commanded 3,000 men to drink the lake dry, only to laugh when they all drowned. And while he was drinking wine it was required that he ride on someone’s back like a horse. Records from the later Qin Dynasty say that during the last year of Jie’s reign, ice formed during the summer mornings and frost occurred through July. He drank a type of pure alcohol wine (清醇). In the 11th year, he summoned all his vassals to his court. Tang of Shang succeeded as king by Tang, who inaugurated the Shang Dynasty. There, he found two of the King of Minshan's daughters, Wan and Yan. Tang of Shang recognized that Jie mistreated the people and used this as a way to convince other supporters. A person by the name of Zi Lü was able to win many supporters from as many as 40 smaller kingdoms. Jie ascended to the throne in the year of Renchen (壬辰). He generally disliked people who criticized him, and many were indeed afraid of him. Chengyu Chinese chengyu jie quan fei yao(桀犬吠堯) is used to mean a situation that a person would be favorable to the person they know. Despite this setback, Shang continued to expand on a number of fronts, gathering vassal troops in Jingbo (景亳). He also pointed out that even Jie’s own military generals would not obey his orders. The Youmin kingdom(有緡)    did not come, so Jie attacked and conquered it. He abandoned his original wife Mo Xi (妹喜) and built a pyramid on top of the Tilt Palace for them to live in. About two years later Shang sent his minister Yi Yin as an envoy to Jie. Initially, his capital was in Zhenxun. They both sailed about in the alcohol lake in an orgy of drunken naked men and women bathing and drinking. There was also a disaster at Linsui (聆隧) in the winter. In the 29th year of Jie’s reign he tried to dig a water-tunnel through the Qu mountain, but the next year the mountain collapsed with a landslide. King Jie had no known children with his wives.

Now let me tell you about Sanesan. Now that was one mean king.

According to Faustus Byuzand, when Grigoris arrived in the Caucasian Albanian principality of Maskut (located along the northeastern Azerbaijani and south Dagestani shore of the Caspian Sea) to preach Christianity, its ruler Sanatruk (also known as Sanesan) of the local branch of Arsacides ordered him killed. During the reign of his kinsman Khosrov III the Small, he invaded Armenia with an army of various peoples including Huns and Alans in 337. He converted to Christianity, but then rejected it and slew Grigoris, the bishop who had introduced him to the faith. After occupying Armenia for most of a year, he was defeated and killed by the Armenian general Vatche Mamikonian.

Who could forget Labarna I. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

According to this theory, the first Labarna (in the sense of a title) was Hattusili I, who is normally regarded as the second Labarna. Given the relatively few contemporaneous references to Labarna I personally, some scholars have suggested that pioneering Hittitologists may have erred in assuming that Labarna was the personal name of a king. Tabarna, a variant of Labarna,  is mentioned often in Hattian, Hittite, Hurrian and Akkadian texts from the Hittite archives. Through his conquests, he was responsible for laying the groundwork for the Hittite empire that was to come. Labarna was also a title of early Hittite rulers, such as Hattusili I. Upon PU-Sarruma's death, Labarna and Papahdilmah, one of PU-Sarruma's sons, contended for the throne, with Labarna emerging victorious. Labarna installed his sons as governors in several cities including Tuwanuwa, Hupisna, Landa, and Lusna (the identities of these cities are uncertain, but thought to perhaps be Tyana, Heraclea Cybistra, Laranda, and Lystra).

If we're thinking of kings, let's include Cutzinas. Now that was one mean king.

In late 545, Cutzinas and Iaudas joined Antalas in a march against Carthage, the capital and main stronghold of the Byzantine government in Africa. Martindale, Jones & Morris 1992, p. 368. Shortly after, Cutzinas received the supreme Roman military rank of magister militum from Troglita. A staunch Byzantine ally during the latter stages of the Berber rebellion, he remained an imperial vassal until his murder in 563 by the new Byzantine governor. Cutzinas fought in the ensuing Battle of the Fields of Cato, which was a decisive Byzantine victory: Carcasan fell, and the Berber revolt was crushed as Antalas and the surviving leaders submitted to Troglita. In the summer of 547 Cutzinas accompanied Troglita in his campaign against the Tripolitanian tribes under Carcasan. In 544, Solomon was killed in battle, and over the next year the Byzantine position in Africa crumbled before the rebels. Life Cutzinas was of mixed stock: his father was a Berber, while his mother came from the Roman population of North Africa. Their dispute threatened to spill over into open armed conflict, but the intervention of Troglita prevented this and the official John effected a reconciliation between the two. In January 563, however, the new prefect of Africa, John Rogathinus, refused to hand over the money and had Cutzinas murdered, prompting an uprising from the latter's children. Cutzinas is mentioned by the eyewitness historian Procopius of Caesarea as one of the leaders of the rebellion in the province of Byzacena, alongside Esdilasas, Medisinissas and Iourphouthes. Cutzinas secretly agreed with the Byzantine governor, Areobindus, to betray Antalas, when battle was joined; Areobindus, however, revealed this to Guntharis, a Byzantine commander who was in turn in contact with Antalas and planned to betray Areobindus himself. After this, Cutzinas remained as a vassal chieftain, receiving regular pay from the Byzantine authorities. During the campaign, Cutzinas and the other Berber leaders were crucial in suppressing a near-mutiny of the Byzantine troops due to Antalas' scorched earth strategy. In spring 535, however, the rebels were defeated by the Byzantine military commander Solomon in the battles of Mammes and Mount Bourgaon, and Cutzinas was forced to flee west to Mount Aurasium in Numidia, where he sought the protection of the local Berber ruler, Iaudas.

Who could forget Emperor Ku. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

Wives and Descendants Ku had several wives. Ku, or Gaoxin, is also known as the "White Emperor". The Annals further record that in the 16th year of his reign, he sent his general Chong to defeat the state of Yukwai. Great Chinese emperors: tales of wise and benevolent rule (revised ed.). According to speculative dates calculated after 100 BC by Liu Xin, he is supposed to have ruled from c. 2436 BC to c. 2366 BC, though other dates are also mentioned. The best-known of his consorts are four ladies: Jiang Yuan, Jiandi, Changyi, and Qingdu. The first of Ku's sons to rule the kingdom was Emperor Zhi, who was the son of Changyi. According to Samguk Sagi, the kings of Goguryeo regarded themselves as a descendant of Chinese heroes because he called his surname "Go" (Hanja: 高) as they were the descendant of Gao Yang (Hanja: 高陽) who was a grandchild of the Yellow Emperor and Gaoxin (Hanja: 高辛) who was a great-grandchild of Yellow Emperor. Besides varying in their degree of historicizing Ku, the various sources also differ in what specific stories about him they focus on, so that putting together the various elements of what is known regarding Ku results in a multifaceted story. Although Ku held the title Di, it is unclear what territory, if any, his empire might have consisted of. He went by the name Gaoxin until receiving imperial authority, when he took the name Ku and the title Di, thus being known as Di Ku. Shiji also recorded the lineage names of Zhi's mother as Juzi (娵訾氏) and Yao's mother as Chenfeng (陳鋒氏). After achieving the imperial title, Ku was said to travel seasonally by riding a dragon in spring and summer, and a horse in autumn and winter. According to some traditions, each of these four sons inherited Ku's empire or was ancestral founder of a Chinese dynasty. As emperor When he became emperor, Ku added the title Di, meaning "God-emperor", in front of his name. Emperor Ku, Gaoxin, is the Yellow Emperor's great-grandson.

I'd like to address the legacy of George I . I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

He is said to have sent the king of England a barrel of soil from the Miskito Kingdom and promised to supply 5,000 fighters to the English suppress any revolt that might break out in North America. Spanish officials declared that Dilson was the "governor of the Miskito nation. In exchange, the Tawira Admiral, Dilson II continued negotiations with the Spanish. At the same time, Tempest, the Zambu General traveled to England attempt to persuade the king of England to separate the administration of the English living in Central America from Jamaica, a move which led George to believe he was plotting his overthrow. He gave many around Black River, their largest settlement, but also gave them around Bluefields, which was in land ruled by the Tawira Admiral, a definite move to establish his authority throughout the Miskito Kingdom. "  Dilson also involved Briton, the Governor, who also controlled a Tawira population, in his cause. In addition to Miskitos, the population included 1,400 British inhabitants, of which 136 where white, 112 of mixed race and about 600 slaves, mostly concentrated around the British settlement of Black River, but other concentrations were at Cabo Gracias a Dios and at Bluefields.

Of course, there's Qa'a. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

If Manetho suggested correctly (remembering the tradition), Semerkhet was the father. The Palermo Stone only mentions the year of coronation and some usual cultic events that were celebrated under every king. It is unclear whether "Sneferka" was an alternate name of Qa'a or if he was a separate, ephemeral ruler. Several stone vessel inscriptions mention a second Sed festival for Qa'a, which points to at least 33 years of reign. Qa'aBiénechês, Óubiênthis, VíbenthisRestored tomb stele of Qa'aPharaohReign33 years, ca. Strong clues to that theory are traces of grave robberies and arsons found in the royal  tombs of Abydos. Other versions of copies of Manetho's epitomes give other hellenized names such as Óubiênthis for versions by Eusebius and Víbenthis by armenian versions of Eusebius. This fact plus the high quality of a number of royal steles depicting the king implies that Qa'a's reign was a fairly stable and prosperous period of time. The discovery of the seal impression has been interpreted as evidence that Qa'a was buried, and therefore succeeded, by Hotepsekhemwy, the founder of the second dynasty of Egypt, as Manetho states. Several mastaba tombs of high officials date into Qa'a's reign: Merka (S3505), Henuka (burial unknown), Neferef (burial also unknown) and Sabef (buried in the royal necropolis of Qa'a). For the use in Islamic architecture, see Qa'a (room). This tomb was excavated by German archaeologists in 1993 and proved to contain 26 satellite (i.e. Manetho calls Qa'a Biénechês and gives him a reign of 26 years according to the version preserved by Sextus Julius Africanus . It is postulated that Sneferka and Horus Bird fought for power and that Hotepsekhemwy ended the fight and finally ascended the throne of Egypt, thus starting the Second Dynasty. Note the subsidiary burial around the main chamber. Qa'a had a fairly large tomb in Abydos which measures 98.5 X 75.5 feet or 30 X 23 meters.

I'd like to address the legacy of Lugal-Anne-Mundu. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

There are few authentic contemporary inscriptions for Lugal-Anne-Mundu's reign; he is known mainly from a much later text, purporting to be copied from one of his inscriptions. It is rarely heard from again after this. The Sumerian king list claims he reigned for 90 years, following the defeat of Mesh-ki-ang-Nanna II, son of Nanni, of Ur.

Now let me tell you about Darius (son of Xerxes I). Now that was one mean king.

In 465 BC, Darius may have ascended to the throne as King of Persia after his father was murdered in a conspiracy carried out by Artabanus and Aspamitres the eunuch, who were confidential advisers of Xerxes. Artaxerxes made the co-conspirators responsible for Darius' death. Mithridates the eunuch according to Diodorus of Sicily. He was the eldest son of the Persian king Xerxes I and his wife Amestris, the daughter of Onophas. On seeing this, Masistes fled to Bactria to start a revolt, but was intercepted by Xerxes' army who killed him and his sons. His younger brothers were Hystaspes and Artaxerxes, and his younger sisters were Rhodogyne and Amytis. Artabanus was killed by sword, whilst Aspamitres was left in a tub where he was eaten by insects. At the behest of Xerxes, Artaynte committed adultery with him (Xerxes).

Let's consider Labarna I. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

Upon PU-Sarruma's death, Labarna and Papahdilmah, one of PU-Sarruma's sons, contended for the throne, with Labarna emerging victorious. The existence of Labarna I is questioned by some modern scholars. Archived from the original on 2010-05-16. According to this theory, the first Labarna (in the sense of a title) was Hattusili I, who is normally regarded as the second Labarna. What little is known about him is culled mainly from the Telepinu Proclamation, which states that he overwhelmed his enemies and "made them borders of the sea", a statement which may refer to conquests as far as the Mediterranean coast in the south, and the Black Sea in the north. Given the relatively few contemporaneous references to Labarna I personally, some scholars have suggested that pioneering Hittitologists may have erred in assuming that Labarna was the personal name of a king. Tabarna, a variant of Labarna,  is mentioned often in Hattian, Hittite, Hurrian and Akkadian texts from the Hittite archives.

Of course, there's Kinh Dương Vương. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

Appropriately speaking the words of the historians, King Tu Duc identified these as "stories about ghost buffalo, snake god, myths without standards" and resolutely excluded Kinh Duong and Lac Long from their own history. In Bac Ninh, Kinh Duong Vuong street connecting Ngo Gia Tu street runs through Kinh Bac Cultural Center and ends at Du Ma Street. In 2013 , Bac Ninh province announced a plan to preserve, embellish and promote the population of national historical and cultural relics of Lang and Kinh Duong Vuong Temple with a total investment of more than 491 billion VND. In the story, the daughter of King Dong Dinh married to Kinh Xuyen Vuong's second child, thinking Kinh Xuyen is Kinh Duong. "The horse is dying" is the image of the character Hien Vien betrayed King Than Nong, killed the king and fourteen people, usurped the throne, proclaimed himself a descendant, committed to the curse "North and South do not violate each other". The project is divided into 4 main construction categories, including: relic conservation space, focusing on repairing and embellishing the relics of the Mausoleum and Kinh Duong Vuong Temple, temple grounds, tomb gardens; relic value space includes: ancestral monument, cultural festival square, cultural display ... accompanied by ancillary services to develop spiritual cultural tourism, attracting tourists and technical infrastructure, leveling, roads, electricity lines. In Da Nang, Kinh Duong Vuong road is about 2.1km long in Hoa Minh ward, Lien Chieu district . Liu Yi brought the letter to the Dragon Palace. In Ho Chi Minh City Kinh Duong Vuong Street starts from Phu Lam roundabout in District 6, passes through the main gate of the Western Bus Station and ends at An Lac roundabout in Binh Tan district. This view is said to be consistent with many historians of the Nguyen dynasty (for example, Ngo Thi Si in Dai Viet's history of Tien Bien,    or in Khâm Định Việt's history of epilogue    ). causing the scene "dead people and horses full of peasants". A childrens song with a similar nature is "When drinking water, remember its source(Uống nước nhớ nguồn)" . His mother was Vụ Tiên Nữ (婺僊女, Goddess Vu). Kinh Dương Vương's personal name was Lộc Tục (Hán tự: 祿續). "Acceptance to find" since the Three Kings have accepted to find an institution to be able to build sustainable assets. There are many generations of kings and historians who chose to use them, and consider that to be the truth. Marie-Carine Lall, Edward Vickers Education As a Political Tool in Asia 2009 -Page 143 "Children learn about the legends of the nation's birth, which feature heroic figures such as Kinh Dương Vương, Âu Cơ ... Sơn Tinh – Thủy Tinh, Thánh Gióng.22 The distinction between what is legend and what is scientific history is unclear." After Lieu Nghi got married, every time he got married he would die. places named after the king Kinh Duong Vuong name is given to a number of roads in Ho Chi Minh City , Bac Ninh City , Thuan Thanh District ( Bac Ninh Province ), Hong Linh Town, Da Nang City , ... In fact, in the past half century, under the influence of nationalism , these invented Traditions have become and are becoming irreversible truths. According to Dai Viet Su Ky Toan Thu , Kinh Duong Vuong was king and ruled from about 2879 BC onwards. The book of Khâm Định Việt, from the ancient time of the ancient period, was written: “Yes, I look up the old history, the titles Kinh Dương Vương, Lạc Long Quân in 'The period of the Hong Bang family, which dates from the ancient times of ancient times, belongs to the childhood of pretending based on nothing and making yes, afraid that it is not reliable enough, to accompany the Tang Dynasty novelist Lieu Nghi, taking it as evidence ”16. Kinh Dương Vương's father was Đế Minh (帝明, "Emperor Ming" of Chinese and Vietnamese mythology), the descendant of Thần Nông (Shennong). What year is the name of the warlord? "Ù à ù ập" is an exclamation of a sign of joy. He is considered the first king of the Vietnamese people, and was the father of Lạc Long Quân. The woman said that she was the daughter of the Dragon King in Dong Dinh Lake, who married the second son of Kinh Xuyen, but was mistreated and went to hunt goats. Nghi refused, please return, the Dragon King bestowed a lot of gold and silver jewels. He decoded the lyrics as follows: Chi chi is a branch(chi) of descent of  clans that are linked to  another branch of descents.Chành chành is the next  "branch" to direct family or person with the same sex that succeeds the line if the chi  line dies.

Who could forget Sneferu. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

Sneferu's conquests into Libya and Nubia served two purposes: the first goal was to establish an extensive labour force, and the second goal was to gain access to the raw materials and special products that were available in these countries. As the name suggests, the angle of the inclination changes from 55° to about 43° in the upper levels of the pyramid. Lepre claims: "the Red pyramid remains one of the chief pyramids that may possibly contain secret chambers, not the least of which may be the true burial chamber of King Sneferu himself. The internal components of the Rhomboidal pyramid have also evolved. Buried in Meidum with his wife Nofret. Since there are many periods in Sneferu's reigns for which Egyptologists have few dates—only the years of the 2nd, 7th, 8th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 23rd and 24th count are known for Sneferu before one considers the years after his cattle counts—this pharaoh is most likely to have had a reign in excess of 30 years to manage to build three pyramids in his long rule but not 48 years since the cattle count was not regularly biannual during his kingship. Considering that the remains of King Sneferu have not yet been found, it still may be possible that his sarcophagus and mummy lie hidden in his mysterious last structure. Nefermaat I – eldest son of Sneferu and husband of Itet. It is likely that the pyramid initially was not designed to be built this way, but was modified during construction due to unstable accretion layers. Sneferu's military efforts in ancient Libya led to the capture of 11,000 prisoners and 13,100 head of cattle. The first of Sneferu's massive undertakings is the Pyramid at Meidum. " Whether or not this conjecture is true is left to modern archaeologists to determine. Ankhhaf was married to the King's Daughter Hetepheres. Titles included: Priest of Bastet, Hereditary Prince, Guardian of Nekhen, great one of the five at the house of Thoth. She was named after her mother, Queen Hetepheres. Wikimedia Commons has media related to Meidum Pyramid. In the tomb Sneferu is mentioned as well as Nefertkau's son Nefermaat II and her grandson Sneferukhaf. According to Guillemette Andreu, this is where the king's foreign policy played a large part. Sneferu's ancient cedar wood ship Praise of the Two Lands is the first known instance of a ship being referred to by name. There are two entrances, one from the north and another from the west. Henutsen – King's daughter, married to Khufu. A famous bust of Ankhhaf is now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Complete with a descending northern passage, two underground chambers, and a burial vault, the pyramid mainly follows the conventions of previous tombs in most aspects other than one: instead of being situated underneath the colossal structure, the burial chamber is built directly within the main body albeit very near ground level. Tourists will be able to reach two 4600-year-old chambers through a 79-meter narrow tunnel built from the northern entrance of the pyramid. For the cryptographic hash function, see Snefru. Buried in mastaba G 7050 at Giza. It is the first time for this adjacent pyramid opened to the public after its excavation in 1956. Nefertkau I – King's Daughter of his Body, eldest daughter of Sneferu. Hetepheres I was Sneferu's main wife and the mother of Khufu, the builder of the Great Pyramid on the Giza Plateau. Sneferu, however, was known to have a minimum of at least three years after the cattle count dates: his years after the 10th, the 13th and the 18th count are attested at his Meidum pyramid. This article is about the Egyptian pharaoh. "Egypt's Bent Pyramid opens to visitors". Although the absence of these features have dissuaded many archaeologists from further studying the Red Pyramid, Lepre is convinced that there are secret chambers waiting to be uncovered within the stone superstructure. The Papyrus Prisse, a Middle Kingdom source, supports the fact that King Huni was indeed Sneferu's predecessor. Upon first glance, one may be disappointed seeing that the construction of the Red Pyramid seemingly is simpler than its predecessor. Manetho was an Egyptian priest, living in the third century BC, who categorized the pharaohs of dynastic Egypt into  thirty-one dynasties. This idea may stem from the etymology of the king's name, for it can be interpreted as the infinitive "to make beautiful". He built at least three pyramids that survive to this day and introduced major innovations in the design and construction of pyramids. Meritites I, Great of Sceptre and King's Wife, married to her brother Khufu. It states that "the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Huni, came to the landing place (i.e., died), and the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Sneferu, was raised up as a beneficent king in this entire land..." Aside from Sneferu's succession, we learn from this text that later generations considered him to be a "beneficent" ruler. There is some debate among scholars as to Sneferu's claim to the Meidum pyramid, and many credit its origin to King Huni. As time progressed and ideology changed in Ancient Egypt, the monuments of the kings decreased greatly in size. The immense stone structure serves as physical testimony to the transition from the stepped pyramid structure to that of a "true" pyramid structure.

I've heard about Yahdun-Lim. Not the meanest as they come, but let's say they had more bad days than good.

After having established internal peace, he built a temple to the god Shamash. His kingdom was threatened by incursions from various nomad tribes, such as the Canaanites, but he was able to subjugate them and force them to pay tribute. He led a successful campaign to the coast of the Mediterranean. The former, of Amorite origin, became king after the death of his father Iagitlim. In the chaos that followed, Shamshi-Adad occupied Mari.

I recall Erra-imitti. Now that was one mean king.

Enlil-bâni, who sat on the throne, did not resign and was elevated to the royal office. When the omens predicted impending doom for a monarch, it was customary to appoint a substitute as a "statue though animate",[nb 3] a scape-goat who stood in the place of the king but did not exercise power for a hundred days to deflect the disaster, at the end of which the proxy and his spouse would be ritually slaughtered and the king would resume his throne. 1868–1861 BC (middle chronology), was king of Isin, modern Ishan al-Bahriyat, and according to the Sumerian King List ruled for eight years. a b Chronicle of Early Kings (ABC 20) A 31 to 36 and repeated as B 1 to 7. The later regnal year-names offer some glimmer of events, for example “the year following the year Erra-Imittī seized Kisurra"[nb 1] (the modern site of Abū-Ḥaṭab) for the date of a receipt for a bridal gift and “the year Erra-Imittī destroyed the city wall of Kazallu,”[nb 2] a city allied with Larsa and antagonistic to Isin and its ally, Babylon. He was succeeded by Ikūn-pî-Ištar, according to two variant copies of the Sumerian King List, or Enlil-bâni, if the other sources are correct. Erra-imittī died in his palace while swallowing hot porridge[nb 4] in little sips.

I've heard about Etakkama. Now that was one mean king.

Etakkama was the author of one letter, EA 189. I serve the king, my lord, but Biryawaza caused the loss of all  lan[ds. Thus do I serve you along wh all my brothers, and wherever there is war against the king, I go, together with my troops, together with my chariots, and together with all my brothers. —EA 189, lines 1-20, Rev: lines 1-27 (bottom of tablet-letter damaged, lacuna of 2-5 sentences(?)) Besides claiming his loyalty to Pharaoh, Etakkama is revealing how Biryawaza, the King of Dimašqu, (Damascus) is really the problem in Upu, the region surrounding Damascus. Etakkama is referenced in 11 of the 382 EA letters, (EA for 'el Amarna'), and especially, a series of 4 identical letters concerning: Amqu, the region of the Beqaa in Lebanon. Etakkama, as a common name, but also, Aitukama, Atak(k)ama, Etak(k)ama, and Itak(k)ama is the name for the 'mayor' (king) of Qidšu, (Kadesh) of the 1350–1335 BC Amarna letters correspondence. The 'Amqu region' is the Beqaa Valley area to the northeast (of Damascus), in Lebanon.

Now let me tell you about Telipinu. Now that was one mean king.

Telepinu is perhaps most famous for drawing up the Edict of Telepinu which dictated the laws of succession for the Hittite throne. If a prince of the first rank does not exist, (then) let he who is a son of second rank become king. He was able to recover a little ground from the Hurrians of Mitanni, by forming an alliance with the Hurrians of Kizzuwatna; however, with the end of his reign, the Hittite Empire enters a temporary "Dark Ages", the Middle Kingdom, lasting around 70 years, when records become too scanty to draw many conclusions. Let a prince – a son of the first rank only be installed as king! Family Alluwamna was a son-in-law of Telipinu, because he married Princess Harapšeki, and Telipinu was her father. During Telipinu’s reign, Huzziya and his five brothers were killed.

If we're thinking of kings, let's include Hedju Hor. Pretty nice as far as kings go.

His existence is controversial. Hedju-Hor is only known from two clay jugs from Tura in the eastern Nile Delta and one from Abu Zeidan on the northeastern tip of the Nile Delta, Egyptologists were brainstorming on the idea on that on this questions but then which his serekh appears. It is thought by some that his rule was around 3250 BC, but though accurate details of his rule are currently unavailable, but the available ruler is around 3250 BC due to his rule being in prehistory. Egyptologist Wolfgang Helck held him as a Pharaoh of Dynasty 0 and has identified him with Wash, who is known as the ruler defeated by Narmer on the Narmer Palette, an opinion later shared by Edwin van den Brink. By contrast, Toby Wilkinson and Jochem Kahl both argue that Hedju Hor was not a pre-dynastic Pharaoh but rather a ruler of a small proto-state of the pre-dynastic era and have attributed to him the title King.

I'd be remiss if I forgot James I of Cyprus. Now that was one mean king.

James was the third son of Hugh IV of Cyprus and his second wife, Alix of Ibelin. In 1393, King Leo VI of Armenia died, and James assumed the title of King of Armenia, which was formally given to him in 1396. According to the treaty, James had to leave Cyprus. Since the Genoese had commercial and financial interests in Cyprus that they wanted to protect and exploit, they invaded the island in April 1373. This was accomplished more than seven years after his coronation, in December of 1392. In 1374 he left the island on a ship from Kyrenia. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. James was also titular King of Armenian Cilicia and Jerusalem 1382–1398. James, the other brother, was also said to be among the party that murdered his Peter I, but by this time he had was in prison in Genoa. He was crowned in May 1385 in Saint Sophia Cathedral by Paul Palaiologos Tagaris. The Genoese considered him their chief opponent in Cyprus. During the regency, Peter I's widow Eleanor of Aragon, to avenge her husband's murder, invited the Genoese to invade Cyprus. After the end of the war, in 1375, Eleanor succeeded in arranging the murder of her husband's brother John of Lusignan, Prince of Antioch (the former regent), whom she claimed she was responsible for her husband's murder. The Genoese, before they would agree to release him to go back to Cyprus, negotiated with him to receive new privileges for commercial activities, and they received his signature on  an "extortionate" agreement on February 2, 1383. James fought well in command of forces in Kyrenia, successfully resisting this Genoese attack. James's escorts from Genoa were unable to complete their mission according to the terms of the agreement, and the time limit they had been given ran out. Before becoming king, James had other offices and was known for his resistance against the Genoese invasion of Cyprus. Ebook available on Google Books, https://books.google.com/, accessed 7/9/2019. Perot privately encouraged the widow of Peter II, Queen Valentina, to take over the island, but publicly he supported her daughter Mariette or Margaret. While awaiting James's return from prison, the Kingdom of Cyprus was governed by a regency council of 12 nobles. 1332 – August 4, 1369/1370) was a Constable of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. James's second brother, John, titular Prince of Antioch, Constable of Cyprus, as the eldest living son of Hugh IV, was regent for three years during the minority of Peter II, who was crowned in January of 1372. The Montolif brothers were executed. After he signed the agreement to the terms of release in 1383, he and his wife returned to Genoa in the custody of the Genoese, but in the meantime, a number of nobles objected to these terms and sought a different monarch.

I'd be remiss if I forgot Sauromaces I of Iberia. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

The contemporary ties with the Iranian world are also emphasized by the name “Saurmag” itself, which is based on a root from Scytho-Sarmatian. Learning of the plot, Saurmag took refuge in the land of Dzurdzuks (ancestors of modern-day Vainakhs), a country of his mother’s origin. The Life of Kings, written c. 800, identifies Saurmag as the son and successor of Parnavaz, the founder of the Parnavaziani dynasty, and establishes a pattern of succession based upon primogeniture. Saurmag (Georgian: საურმაგი) was a monarch of Kartli (an ancient Georgian kingdom known as Iberia to the Classical sources) listed as the second king in the traditional royal list of medieval Georgian chronicles. With the Dzurdzuk help, Saurmag quashed a revolt, and went on to create a new class of nobles directly dependent on the crown.

Let's consider Den . I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

The artifacts were found at Abydos, Saqqara and Abu Rawash. Such a course of action was not unusual in ancient Egyptian history. In the original layout for the tomb, a wooden door was located about halfway up the staircase, and a portcullis placed in front of the burial chamber, designed to keep out tomb robbers. 33rd year: Stretching the cords (a foundation ceremony) for the divine fortress Isut-Netjeru (“thrones of the gods”). The floor of the tomb was paved in red and black granite from Aswan, the first architectural use of such hard stone on a large scale. A nearby inscription begins with “Henu...” but it is unclear, if that means “provision” or if it is the first syllable of the name “Henu-Ka” (a high official). Tomb T is among the largest and most finely-built of the tombs in this area, and is the first to feature a staircase and a floor made of granite. Twenty labels made of ivory and ebony were found in his tomb, 18 by Flinders Petrie in the spoil heaps left by the less thorough Émile Amélineau. He also had numerous sons and daughters; his possible successors could have been king Anedjib and king Semerkhet. Among these labels are the earliest known depictions of a pharaoh wearing the double-crown of Egypt (see above), as well as running between ritual stele as part of the Sed festival. Two or perhaps even three reliefs are showing the standing king and some of his officials. The middle right section reports about the raid of the city "beautiful door" and about a daughter of Den suffering from an unknown disease. Qua-Neith ?FatherDjetMotherMerneithBurialTomb T, Umm El Qa'ab Den, also known as Hor-Den, Dewen and Udimu, is the Horus name of a pharaoh of the Early Dynastic Period who ruled during the First Dynasty of Egypt. Most religious and political happenings from Den's reign are recorded in the numerous ivory tags and from the Palermo Stone inscription. Therefore, Meritneith reigned as a regent or de facto pharaoh for some time. At the left side the name of the high official Iny-Ka is inscribed. 41st year: Appearance of the king of Lower- and... (rest is missing)  The second celebration of the Hebsed (a throne jubilee) is affirmed by several stone vessel inscriptions from Den's necropolis. The left part of the label describes the content of the vessel that once belonged to the label and mentions the high official Hemaka, who was obviously responsible for the delivery of the labeled jar. Subsidiary tombs and palatial mastabas at Sakkara belonged to high officials such as Ipka, Ankh-ka, Hemaka, Nebitka, Amka, Iny-ka and Ka-Za. Den's mother was rewarded with her own tomb of royal dimensions and with her own mortuary cult. It seems that Den sent troops to the Sinai Peninsula and the eastern desert a number of times. 34th year: Stretching the cords for the royal palace of the divine fortress Isut-Netjeru by the high priest of Seshat. Egyptologists and historians generally believe that Den had a reign of 42 years, based on inscriptions on the Palermo Stone. This practice seems to have ceased by the end of the dynasty, with ushabtis taking the place of the bodies of actual people to aid the pharaohs with the work expected of them in the afterlife. For example, one of these tags reports on an epidemic then affecting Egypt. The birth name of Den was misread in Ramesside times. Den's wives were the queens Semat, Nakht-Neith and, possibly, Qaineit. For example, the Medical Papyrus of Berlin (the Ramesside era) discusses several methods of treatment and therapies for a number of different diseases. They are again mentioned in a rock inscription in the Sinai Peninsula under Semerkhet, one of Den's successors. Some of these methods are said to originate from the reign of Den, but this statement may merely be trying to make the medical advice sound traditional and authoritative. The surface is artistically parted into sections, each of them showing individual events. Also found are seal impressions that provide the earliest confirmed king list. The Turin King List refers to “Qenentj”, which is quite difficult to translate. Den's serekh name was "Den" or "Dewen", most likely meaning "he who brings the water". The floor of his tomb at Umm El Qa'ab near Abydos is made of red and black granite, the first time in Egypt this hard stone was used as a building material. During his long reign he established many of the customs of court ritual and royalty used by later rulers and he was held in high regard by his immediate successors. He is the best archaeologically-attested ruler of this period. It seems that he was too young to rule himself. Another tag, known as the “MacGregor Label”, shows the first complete depiction of an Egyptian king with the so-called nemes headdress. Discovered in the tomb of Den, now in the Egyptian Museum.

Of course, there's Ny-Hor. Pretty nice as far as kings go.

Vorbericht, Mitteilungen des deutschen archäologischen Instituts Kairo 38 (1982), p.p. Some Egyptologists believe that Ny-Hor is an alternative naming for the Pharaoh Narmer. Evidence Ny-Hor's name appears predominantly on clay and stone vessels found in tombs near Tarchan, and in Tura and Tarjan and Nagada. Biography Very little is known of his rule, and his existence remains controversial. Egyptologist Ludwig D. Morenz, on the other hand, warns against specifying any concrete option, since the evidence is too tenuous at this time. Evidence of his rule is very poor and its existence is doubted by some of the research, and opinion about the actual reading and interpretation of the name are divided. Thomas Schneider, Günter Dreyer, and Werner Kaiser, on the other hand, consider that Ny-Hor was not Narmer as bones found in the graves of Tarchan predate the time in which Narmer lived.

He is not to be confused with the another king Aramu (also known as Adramu and Atarsamek) who ruled at the same time in Bit Agusi and also fought Shalemaneser III. His capital at Arzashkun was captured by Shalmaneser. The name is likely etymologically related to Hindu Rama.

His brother was tlatoani Cuauhtémoc. The successor of Chimalpilli II was Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin, who also became tlatoani of Tenochtitlan, as well as its governor (Cabildo of San Juan Tenochtitlan) under the colonial Spanish system of government .

If we're thinking of kings, let's include Leizu. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

She is attributed with inventing the silk reel, which joins fine filaments into a thread strong enough for weaving. Leizu found that she could unwind this soft and lovely thread around her finger. According to tradition, she discovered sericulture, and invented the silk loom, in the 27th century BC. Zhuanxu's uncles and his father, the sons of Huangdi, were bypassed and Zhuanxu was selected as heir to Huangdi. According to one account, a silkworm cocoon fell into her tea, and the heat unwrapped the silk until it stretched across her entire garden.

She persuaded her husband to give her a grove of mulberry trees, where she could domesticate the worms that made these cocoons.

Those of you up on your history know Cyrus the Younger. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

According to Plutarch, "his resentment for  made him more eagerly desirous of the kingdom than before. Frequently when he had tasted some specially excellent wine, he would send the half remaining flagon to some friend with a message to say: "Cyrus says, this is the best wine he has tasted for a long time, that is his excuse for sending it to you. Some eunuchs found Cyrus and tried to bring him to safety, but a Caunian among the king's camp followers struck a vein behind his knee with a dart, making him fall and strike his head on a stone, whereupon he died. When Cyrus was recalled to Susa by his father Darius, he gave Lysander the revenues from all of his cities of Asia Minor. Cyrus managed to gather a large army by beginning a quarrel with Tissaphernes, satrap of Caria, about the Ionian towns; he also pretended to prepare an expedition against the Pisidians, a mountainous tribe in the Taurus, which was never obedient to the Empire. In the spring of 401 BC, Cyrus united all his forces into an army now including Xenophon's "Ten Thousand", and advanced from Sardis without announcing the object of his expedition. As soon as his age permitted, the same pre-eminence showed itself in his fondness for the chase, not without a certain appetite for perilous adventure in facing the wild beasts themselves. In October 401 BC, the battle of Cunaxa ensued. The encounter was related by Xenophon. In him, Cyrus found a man who was willing to help him become king, just as Lysander himself hoped to become absolute ruler of Greece by the aid of the Persian prince. Robin Waterfield - Xenophon's Retreat: Greece, Persia, and the End of the Golden Age (London: Faber and Faber Ltd., 2006) is a summary of Xenophon's Anabasis or The Expedition of Cyrus. Or, perhaps, there was a great dearth of provender, when, through the number of his servants and his own careful forethought, he was enabled to get supplies for himself; at such times he would send to his friends in different parts, bidding them feed their horses on his hay, since it would not do for the horses that carried his friends to go starving. Cyrus saw that the outcome depended on the fate of the king; he therefore wanted Clearchus, the commander of the Greeks, to take the centre against Artaxerxes. The prayer has been attributed to him, "God grant I may live along enough to recompense my friends and requite my foes with a strong arm. " Soon after Darius died, around the time of Artaxerxes II's accession in 404 BC, Tissaphernes (Ciθrafarna) denounced Cyrus' plan to assassinate his brother, and Cyrus was captured, but by the intercession of Parysatis, Cyrus was pardoned and sent back to his satrapy. Cyrus had 10,400 Greek hoplites (citizen-soldiers), 2,500 peltasts (light infantry), and an Asiatic army of approximately 10,000 under the command of Ariaeus. He would tell no lies to any one. The king had only been warned at the last moment by Tissaphernes and gathered an army in haste; Cyrus advanced into Babylonia before he met with an enemy. Thus, Cyrus put all his means at the disposal of Lysander in the Peloponnesian War. Cyrus the Younger had obtained the support of the Spartans after having asked them "to show themselves as good friend to him, as he had been to them during their war against Athens", in reference to the support he had given the Spartan in the Peloponnesian War against Athens a few years earlier. The satrapy of Cyrus the Younger is delineated in green. About Cyrus' childhood, Plutarch wrote, "Cyrus, from his earliest youth, showed something of a headstrong and vehement character; Artaxerxes, on the other side, was gentler in everything, and of a nature more yielding and soft in its action. Therefore, in the war with Tissaphernes, all the states of their own accord chose Cyrus in lieu of Tissaphernes, except only the men of Miletus, and these were only alienated through fear of him, because he refused to abandon their exiled citizens; and his deeds and words bore emphatic witness to his principle: even if they were weakened in number or in fortune, he would never abandon those who had once become his friends. Tissaphernes claimed to have killed the rebel himself, and Parysatis later took vengeance upon the slayer of her favorite son. Expedition against Artaxerxes II (401 BC)  Battle of Cunaxa, where Cyrus the Younger died. In 408 BC, after the victories of Alcibiades leading to an Athenian resurgence, Darius II decided to continue the war against Athens and give strong support to the Spartans. Once a bear made a furious rush at him, and without wincing he grappled with her, and was pulled from his horse, receiving wounds the scars of which were visible through life; but in the end he slew the creature, nor did he forget him who first came to his aid, but made him enviable in the eyes of many. The history of Cyrus and of the retreat of his Greek mercenaries is told by Xenophon in his Anabasis. According to Xenophon, Cyrus the Younger was born after the accession of his father in 424 BC. She likewise got vengeance on Masabates, the king's eunuch, who had cut off Cyrus' hand and head, by winning him from her son Artaxerxes in a game of dice and having him flayed alive. To my mind a man's chief ornament is the adornment of nobly-adorned friends."

I've heard about Shaohao. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

The historicity of Shaohao is controversial. Documentary evidence of Shaohao originates in the extant version of the ancient text Zuo Zhuan, but the lineage recited there, that includes Shaohao, is not corroborated by contemporaneous or earlier texts. Jiaoji's son, Ku, and grandsons (Zhi and Yao) would become emperors though. Legends with alternative origin A different legend, in the Bamboo Annals (019), posits that Shaohao was not the Yellow Emperor's son but the son of a certain Lady Jie (Hanzi:女節), who miraculously conceived him after seeing a rainbow-like star flowing downwards onto the Hua islet (Hanzi: 華渚). This theory posits that Liu Xin was keen to create a narrative of the succession of legendary kings and subsequent dynasties, which would satisfactorily reflect the "succession of five elements" theory of dynastic succession, as well as a rotation between different lineages, which would together legitimise the rule of the Han Dynasty and/or the succession by the Xin Dynasty. The two enjoyed many intimate nights together on her raft and they created a son. Another legend says that his mother, a weaver goddess, was a beautiful fairy named Huang'e who fell in love with the planet Venus while drifting along the Milky Way. A stone-faced pyramid at the Shaohao Tomb near Qufu Although his kingdom was successful for many years, he moved back to the west and left his kingdom of birds to his son Chong. However, Shiji listed no emperor between the Yellow Emperor and Zhuanxu. Controversy over historicity Whether Shaohao actually existed, or was a sovereign, is controversial. The Doubting Antiquity School of historians, represented by Gu Jiegang, posited that Shaohao was inserted into the orthodox legendary lineage of ancient rulers by Han Dynasty imperial librarian Liu Xin, as part of a wide-ranging campaign of editing ancient texts, in order to either justify the rule of the Han imperial house, or the brief Xin Dynasty that overthrew it. He chose the four seasons of the year to watch over the remaining birds. Whether, and at what point, Shaohao was inserted into the narrative of ancient Chinese rulers remains controversial amongst historians. Inside the Temple of Shaohao, at his supposed grave site (Qufu, Shandong) Shaohao (Chinese: 少昊; pinyin: Shàohào), also known as Shao Hao, Jin Tian or Xuanxiao, was a legendary Chinese sovereign who reigned c. 2600 BC. With a different son, Ru Shou, he made his home on Changliu Mountain, where he could rule over the Western Heavens. Shaohao's tomb, most likely built during the Song dynasty, is traditionally located in present-day Jiuxian ("old prefecture") village, on the eastern outskirts of Qufu. The Doubting Antiquity School therefore theorises that Liu Xin took an existing but separate legendary figure, and inserted him into the legendary lineage of early rulers during his edit of the Zuo Zhuan.

If we're thinking of kings, let's include Hedju Hor. Pretty nice as far as kings go.

Egyptologist Wolfgang Helck held him as a Pharaoh of Dynasty 0 and has identified him with Wash, who is known as the ruler defeated by Narmer on the Narmer Palette, an opinion later shared by Edwin van den Brink. The name Hedhu-Hor means The maces of Horus. Almost nothing is known of his rule, as he is known only from inscriptions found in the Delta region and pottery shards from Tura. It has been variously conjectured he was possibly the first pharaoh of Lower Egypt, or the last or that he was a member of Dynasty 0. It is thought by some that his rule was around 3250 BC, but though accurate details of his rule are currently unavailable, but the available ruler is around 3250 BC due to his rule being in prehistory.

I'd be remiss if I forgot Antigonus III Doson. Pretty nice as far as kings go.

Unlike his Antigonid ancestors, he had no viable rivals to challenge his right to rule. The meaning of this is uncertain. Antigonus also had a brother named Echecrates, whose son, named Antigonus after Doson himself, was put to death by Perseus on the latter's accession to the throne of Macedon. As a consequence, the Macedonian nobility turned to Doson, who was subsequently made regent of the kingdom and then married his predecessor's widow and the mother of Philip, Chryseis. In less than a decade of rule he not only secured the borders of his nation, he also re-established Macedon as the dominant power in the region. According to Plutarch it "implied that he was given to promising but did not perform his engagements", though even the exact meaning of this is unclear. According to Plutarch, both the Macedonian army and nobility thought the political situation too volatile to wait for Philip V to mature enough to assume command. His death occurred soon after, when he returned to Macedon and engaged the Illyrian army; for though Macedonian forces were once again victorious, the commander became sick during the battle (possibly though not necessarily as a result of a ruptured blood vessel) and died. Antigonus did not long survive this victory. Doson's father, Demetrius the Fair, died sometime around 250 BC, as a result of events that occurred after being summoned from Macedonia to Cyrene to marry Berenice II, the daughter and heir of Magas of Cyrene. Establishing his base on the heights above Corinth, Antigonus reconstituted a broad-based Hellenic league (224 BC) under his leadership before launching his attack on Sparta. However, it was only after Doson demonstrated his leadership abilities by succeeding (where his cousin Demetrius had failed) in defeating the Dardanii invaders and also in putting down a rebellion by the Thessalians, and showing his rule to be generally moderate and good, that he was given the title of king. When Sparta, under Cleomenes III, attempted to establish hegemony over the whole Peloponnese, Aratus of Sicyon - long the leader of Greek opposition to Macedonian domination - invited Antigonus to intervene (226 BC). On his way, Antigonus passed through Tegea and Argos, his arrival at the latter coinciding with the beginning of the Nemean Games, where he was honoured by the Achaean League and various other cities.

I've heard about Seti II. Now that was one mean king.

However, Messuy's burial in Tomb S90 in Nubia has been discovered to contain only funerary objects naming Merneptah which suggests that 1) Messuy may have died during Merneptah's reign and 2) Seti II may have merely associated himself with an official who had actively served his father as Viceroy of Kush. The second is the records of the trial of Paneb. Seti II likely died sometime late in IV Akhet or early in I Peret; Wolfgang Helck and R.J. Demarée have now proposed I Peret 2 as the date of Seti II's actual death, presumably since it is 70 days before the day of his burial. This suggests that Seti II's reign at Thebes was interrupted by the rise of a rival: king Amenmesse in Upper Egypt. Vizier Khaemter's scenes in Nubia which were carved when he served as the Viceroy of Kush were so thoroughly erased that until Rolf Krauss' and Labib Habachi's articles were published in the 1970s, his career here as viceroy was almost unknown, notes Frank J. This was based on a number of funerary objects found in the tomb of Siptah bearing the name of Tiaa as King's Wife and King's Mother. Ulrich Luft, (Budapest: La Chair d’Égyptologie de l’Université Eötvös Loráno de Budapest, 1992), 270, n.12. However, Neferhotep is attested in office in the work register list of Ostraca MMA 14.6.217, which also recorded Seti II's accession to the throne and was later reused to register workers' absences under this king's reign. Finally, and most importantly, it is well known that the chief foreman of Deir el-Medina, a certain Neferhotep, was killed in the reign of king Amenmesse on the orders of a certain 'Msy' who was either Amenmesse himself or one of this king's agents, according to Papyrus Salt 124. The first of these is the "Tale of Two Brothers", a fabulous story of troubles within a family on the death of their father, which may have been intended in part as political satire on the situation of the two half brothers. If Seti II's 6-year reign followed that of the usurper Amenmesse, then this chief foreman would not have been mentioned in a document which dated to the start of Seti II's reign since Neferhotep was already dead. This was an unprecedented act on his part for Bay, who was of Syrian descent and was not connected by marriage or blood ties to the royal family. Seti II's earliest prenomen in his First Year was 'Userkheperure Setepenre' which is written above an inscription of Messuy, a Viceroy of Nubia under Merneptah, on a rock outcropping at Bigeh Island. Twosret would rule as regent for Siptah and later as Pharaoh. It was abandoned in the late Bronze Age collapse, where a part of the temple seems to have been used by Midianite nomads, linked to the worship of a bronze serpent discovered in the area. In January 1908, the Egyptologist Edward R. Ayrton, in an excavation conducted for Theodore M. Davis, discovered a small burial in tomb KV56 which Davis referred to as 'The Gold Tomb' in his publication of the discovery in the Valley of the Kings; it proved to contain a small cache of jewelry that featured the name of Seti II. Due to the relative brevity of his reign, Seti's tomb was unfinished at the time of his death. His throne name, Userkheperure Setepenre, means "Powerful are the manifestations of Re, the chosen one of Re. According to an inscribed ostraca document from the Deir el-Medina worker's community, Seti II's death was announced to the workmen by "The  police Nakht-min" on Year 6, I Peret 19 of Seti II's reign. A set of "earrings, finger-rings, bracelets, a series of necklace ornaments and amulets, a pair of silver 'gloves' and a tiny silver sandal" were found within this tomb. This indicates that the reigns of Amenmesse and Seti II must have partly overlapped with one another and suggests that both rulers were rivals who were fighting each another for the throne of Egypt. The erasures were subsequently repaired by Seti II's agents. If Amennakhte's testimony can be trusted, Paneb had allegedly stolen stone from the tomb of Seti II while still working on its completion—for the embellishment of his own tomb—besides purloining or damaging other property belonging to that monarch. Seti II also founded a station for a barge on the courtyard in front of the pylon II at Karnak, and chapels of the Theban Triad – Amun, Mut and Khonsu. Neferhotep, one of the two chief workmen of the Deir el-Medina necropolis, had been replaced by Paneb, his troublesome son-in-law. Seti II also expanded the copper mining at Timna Valley in Edom, building an important temple to Hathor, the cow goddess, in the region. Archived from the original on 16 September 2009. An obelisk erected by Seti II in front of Karnak temple Seti II promoted Chancellor Bay to become his most important state official and built 3 tombs – KV13, KV14, and KV15 – for himself, his Senior Queen Twosret and Bay in the Valley of the Kings. Evidently this 'Mose' must have been a person of the highest importance, perhaps the king Amenmesse himself or a senior ally of the king. Gold earrings containing Seti II's name discovered in KV56 For many years, a certain Tiaa was also accepted as a wife of Seti II and mother of Siptah. This would seem to indicate that Takhat was married to Seti and that Amenmesse was Seti's son and usurped the throne from his own father.

Now let me tell you about John II of Beirut. Was known to have a pretty regular mean streak.

Eschive 1253–1312, lady of Beirut, who married Humphrey de Montfort, lord of Tyre and Guy constable of Cyprus. His parents were Balian of Ibelin and Eschiva de Montfaucon, daughter of Walter of Montbéliard and Bourgogne de Lusignan of Cyprus. They were defeated at the camp near Tiberias in a route by some Turcomen and John was taken captive along with John of Gibelet, James Vidal, and Thomas Bérard, Grand Master of the Knights Templar.

There's this one -- Sargon of Akkad. Now that was one mean king.

He brought it under one authority. " Van de Mieroop suggested that those two chronicles may refer to the much later Assyrian king, Sargon II of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, rather than to Sargon of Akkad. The Louvre has fragments of two Sargonic victory steles recovered from Susa (where they were presumably transported from Mesopotamia in the 12th century BC). Two other sons, Shu-Enlil (Ibarum) and Ilaba'is-takal (Abaish-Takal), are known. Ewing William (1910) suggested Sargon based on his unification of the Babylonians and the Neo-Assyrian birth legend. The god Enlil gave to him  the [Lower (Sea). A Neo-Assyrian text from the 7th century BC purporting to be Sargon's autobiography asserts that the great king was the illegitimate son of a priestess. His daughter Enheduanna was a priestess who composed ritual hymns. Rīmuš, the son of Sargon, ruled for {WB: 9} {IB: 7, L1+N1: 15} years. Yigal Levin (2002) suggested that Nimrod was a recollection of Sargon and his grandson Naram-Sin, with the name "Nimrod" derived from the latter. Sargon is also one of the many suggestions for the identity or inspiration for the biblical Nimrod. The name of Sargon in cuneiform (Akkadian: 𒊬𒊒𒄀 𒈗 Šar-ru-gi lugal "King Sargon") appears faintly in front of his face. He washed his weapons in the sea. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. Man-ištiššu, the older brother of Rīmuš, the son of Sargon, ruled for {WB: 15} {L1+N1: 7} years. His successors until the Gutian conquest of Sumer are also known as the "Sargonic Dynasty" and their rule as the "Sargonic Period" of Mesopotamian history. The names of these four years describe his campaigns against Elam, Mari, Simurrum (a Hurrian region), and Uru'a (an Elamite city-state). An important source for "Sargonic heroes" in oral tradition in the later Bronze Age is a Middle Hittite (15th century BC) record of a Hurro-Hittite song, which calls upon Sargon and his immediate successors as "deified kings" (dšarrena). Bachvarova, Mary R., "Sargon the Great: from history to myth", chapter 8 in: From Hittite to Homer: The Anatolian Background of Ancient Greek Epic' , Cambridge University Press (2016), 166–198. Apart from these secondary, and partly legendary, accounts, there are many inscriptions due to Sargon himself, although the majority of these are known only from much later copies. While various copies of the Sumerian king list credit Sargon with a 56, 55, or 54-year reign, dated documents have been found for only four different year-names of his actual reign. In absolute years, his reign would correspond to ca. His empire is thought to have included most of Mesopotamia, parts of the Levant, besides incursions into Hurrite and Elamite territory, ruling from his (archaeologically as yet unidentified) capital, Akkad (also Agade). The Hittite version is extant in six fragments, the Akkadian version is known from several manuscripts  found at Amarna, Assur, and Nineveh. Although historically inaccurate and supernatural in nature, The Scorpion King: Rise of a Warrior (2008) features Sargon of Akkad as a murderous army commander who uses black magic. This is one of the few films, if not the only one, to depict Sargon. They enjoyed new popularity in the late eighth century when Sargon II of Assyria sought to associate himself with his famous namesake." Shortly after securing Sumer, Sargon embarked on a series of campaigns to subjugate the entire Fertile Crescent. Sargon of Akkad is sometimes identified as the first person in recorded history to rule over an empire (in the sense of the central government of a multi-ethnic territory), although earlier Sumerian rulers such as Lugal-zage-si might have a similar claim. It is not entirely clear whether the Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II was directly named for Sargon of Akkad, as there is some uncertainty whether his name should be rendered Šarru-ukīn or as Šarru-kēn(u). Joachim Menant published a description of this seal in 1877, reading the king's name as Shegani-shar-lukh, and did not yet identify it with "Sargon the Elder" (who was identified with the Old Assyrian king Sargon I). He usurped the kingship from Lugal-zage-si of Uruk and took it to his own city of Akkad. But because of the evil which he had committed, the great lord Marduk was angry, and he destroyed his people by famine. Sargon shared his name with two later Mesopotamian kings. Only the beginning of the text (the first two columns) is known, from the fragments of three manuscripts. Marduk] alienated (them) from him and inflicted upon (him as punishment) that he could not rest (in his grave). Various copies of the king list give the duration of his reign as either 54, 55 or 56 years. Sargon appears as a legendary figure in Neo-Assyrian literature of the 8th to 7th centuries BC. The first fragments were discovered as early as 1850. Thorkild Jacobsen marked the clause about Sargon's father being a gardener as a lacuna, indicating his uncertainty about its meaning. Manishtushu would be succeeded by his own son, Naram-Sin. For the YouTuber, see Carl Benjamin. His rule also heralds the history of Semitic empires in the Ancient Near East, which, following the Neo-Sumerian interruption (21st/20th centuries BC), lasted for close to fifteen centuries until the Achaemenid conquest following the 539 BC Battle of Opis. Ur-Zababa and Lugal-zage-si are both listed as kings, but separated by several additional named rulers of Kish, who seem to have been merely governors or vassals under the Akkadian Empire. I ascended the upper mountains; I burst through the lower mountains. {P3+BT14: 157 are the years of the dynasty of Sargon.}" In addition, the names of some pre-Sargonic rulers of Kish in the Sumerian king list have been interpreted as having Semitic etymologies, which might extend the Semitic presence in the Near East to the 29th or 30th century. The part of the interpretation of the king's dream has parallels to the biblical story of Joseph, the part about the letter with the carrier's death sentence has similarities to the Greek story of Bellerophon and the biblical story of Uriah. Famine and war threatened Sargon's empire during the latter years of his reign. Tablets with fragments of a Sargon Birth Legend were found in the Library of Ashurbanipal. My high priestess mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. In addition to the Biblical form (סרגון), the Hebrew spelling סרגן has been found in an inscription in Khorsabad, suggesting that the name in the Neo-Assyrian period might have been pronounced Sar(ru)gīn, the voicing representing a regular development in Neo-Assyrian. Chronicles concerning early Babylonian kings. Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of cuneiform script. Joseph Campbell has also made such comparisons. In the east, Sargon defeated four leaders of Elam, led by the king of Awan. Bendt Alster, "A Note on the Uriah Letter in the Sumerian Sargon Legend", Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und Vorderasiatische Archäologie 77.2 (1987). The Assyrian and Babylonian kings who based their empires in Mesopotamia saw themselves as the heirs of Sargon's empire. Whatsoever king shall be exalted after me, ... Let him rule, let him govern the black-headed peoples; mighty mountains with axes of bronze let him destroy; let him ascend the upper mountains, let him break through the lower mountains; the country of the sea let him besiege three times; Dilmun let him capture; To great Dur-ilu let him go up." Sargon was succeeded by his son Rimush; after Rimush's death another son, Manishtushu, became king. He also names various rulers of the east whom he vanquished, such as "Luh-uh-ish-an, son of Hishibrasini, king of Elam", king of Elam" or " Sidga'u, general of Parahshum", who later also appears in an inscription by Rimush. The claim that Sargon was the original founder of Akkad has been called into question with the discovery of an inscription mentioning the place and dated to the first year of Enshakushanna, who almost certainly preceded him. Sargon II was a Neo-Assyrian king named after Sargon of Akkad; it is this king whose name was rendered Sargon (סַרְגוֹן) in the Hebrew Bible (Isaiah 20:1). He crossed the sea in the east. "Review of The Sargon Legend: A Study of the Akkadian Text and the Tale of the Hero Who Was Exposed at Birth.

He marched to Kazallu and turned Kazallu into a ruin heap, so that there was not even a perch for a bird left. He is not to be confused with Sargon I, a later king of the Old Assyrian period. Afterward he attacked the land of Subartu in his might, and they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled that revolt, and defeated them; he accomplished their overthrow, and their widespreading host he destroyed, and he brought their possessions into Akkad. Archived from the original on 8 May 2008. Stephanie Dalley, Sargon of Agade in literature: "The episode of dreams which Joseph interpreted for Pharaoh in Genesis 37 bears a notable resemblance to Sargon’s interpretation of the dreams of the king of Kish in the Sumerian Legend of Sargon, the same legend contains the motif of the messenger who carries a letter which orders his own death, comparable to the story of Uriah in 2 Samuel 11 (and of Bellerophon in Iliad 6). Mesopotamia: Civilization Begins. Archived from the original on 3 September 2004. Soon after this, Ur-Zababa invites Sargon to his chambers to discuss a dream of Sargon's, involving the favor of the goddess Inanna and the drowning of Ur-Zababa by the goddess. Versions of this narrative in both Hittite and Akkadian have been found. " A group of four Babylonian texts, summarized as "Sargon Epos" or Res Gestae Sargonis, shows Sargon as a military commander asking the advice of many subordinates before going on campaigns. Its text was edited by Arno Poebel (1909) and Leon Legrain (1926). When Sargon returns to Ur-Zababa, the king becomes frightened again and decides to send Sargon to king Lugal-zage-si of Uruk with a message on a clay tablet asking him to slay Sargon. Foster (1982) argued that the reading of 55 years as the duration of Sargon's reign was, in fact, a corruption of an original interpretation of 37 years. Inventing Empire in Ancient Mesopotamia, Routledge, 2016. Here, Sargon is mentioned as the son of a gardener, former cup-bearer of Ur-Zababa of Kish. " The Chronicle of Early Kings (ABC 20:18–19) likewise states that late in his reign, Sargon "dug up the soil of the pit of Babylon, and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Agade. Sargon became the subject of legendary narratives describing his rise to power from humble origins and his conquest of Mesopotamia in later Assyrian and Babylonian literature. He frequently calls himself "king of Akkad" first, after the city of Akkad which he apparently founded. Sargon of Akkad (/ˈsɑːrɡɒn/; Akkadian: 𒊬𒊒𒄀 Šar-ru-gi), also known as Sargon the Great, was the first ruler of the Akkadian Empire, known for his conquests of the Sumerian city-states in the 24th to 23rd centuries BC.

During Sargon's reign, East Semitic was standardized and adapted for use with the cuneiform script previously used in the Sumerian language into what is now known as the "Akkadian language". Akki, the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. Sargon may indeed have introduced the notion of "empire" as understood in the later Assyrian period; the Neo-Assyrian Sargon Text, written in the first person, has Sargon challenging later rulers to "govern the black-headed people" (i.e.

I recall Gubazes II of Lazica. Now that was one mean king.

In 550, a pro-Persian revolt broke out among the Abasgians, a people that neighboured Lazica to the north. The allies failed, however, to prevent another Persian army from reinforcing Petra, and Dagisthaeus was recalled and replaced by Bessas. In the spring of the next year, Gubazes and Dagisthaeus combined their forces, destroyed Phabrizus's army in a surprise attack, and pursued the survivors into Caucasian Iberia. In 540, Khosrau broke the "Eternal Peace" of 532 and invaded the Byzantine province of Mesopotamia. Gubazes eventually quarrelled with the Byzantine generals over the fruitless continuation of the war, and was assassinated by them. Yet, the Persians lacked sufficient supplies, and so, after strengthening the garrison at Petra and leaving a further 5,000 men under Phabrizus to secure its supply routes, Mihr-Mihroe left. Gubazes remained a Byzantine ally during the next few years, as the two empires fought for control of Lazica, with the fortress of Petra as the focal point of the struggle. This provided an opportunity for a high-ranking Lazic noble named Terdetes, who had quarrelled with Gubazes, to betray to the Persians Tzibile, an important fort in the land of the Apsili, a tribe under Lazic suzerainty. However, during the rule of Emperor Justinian I (reigned 527–565), a series of heavy-handed Byzantine measures made them unpopular. As a first step, the Persian ruler planned to assassinate Gubazes. Gubazes II (Georgian: გუბაზ II, Greek: Γουβάζης) was king of Lazica (modern western Georgia) from circa 541 until his assassination in 555. The Byzantines under John Tzibus resisted valiantly from Petra, but Tzibus was killed, and the fortress fell soon after. 560, 1221; Greatrex & Lieu 2002, p. 118. As the Persians were well provisioned, the siege dragged on. Despite enduring harsh conditions in the winter of 551/552, Gubazes rejected the peace offers conveyed by envoys from Mihr-Mihroe. It is very likely that before his accession he had lived for several years at the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, for he is recorded to have been a silentiarius, an influential position at the imperial palace; alternatively, but less probably, he may have been given the title as an honorary appointment after his accession. He was one of the central personalities of the Lazic War (541–562). Gubazes fell from his horse, and one of Rusticus's servants gave him the finishing blow. Martindale, Jones & Morris 1992, p. 559; Bury 1958, p. 113; Greatrex & Lieu 2002, p. 117. Gubazes was married and had children, but neither the name of his wife nor of any of his offspring is known. 113–114; Greatrex & Lieu 2002, p. 117. He originally ascended the throne as a vassal of the Byzantine Empire, but the heavy-handed actions of the Byzantine authorities led him to seek the assistance of Byzantium's main rival, Sassanid Persia. In spring 541, Khosrau and his troops, led by Lazi guides, marched over the mountain passes into Lazica, where Gubazes submitted to him. Khosrau left a Persian garrison at Petra and departed the country, but soon, the Lazi grew discontented: as Christians, they resented the Persians' Zoroastrianism, and they were greatly affected by the cessation of the Black Sea trade with Byzantium. Emperor Justinian, intending to question Gubazes himself, authorized the two generals to arrest him, using force if necessary. The contemporary Byzantine historian Procopius of Caesarea reports that Khosrau, who was aware of Lazica's strategic importance, intended to resettle the entire Lazi people and replace them with Persians. 560, 841, 1103–1104; Bury 1958, p. 118; Greatrex & Lieu 2002, pp. Tzathius' marriage to Valeriana seems to be the earliest recorded marriage between the Lazic and Byzantine elites.

How about that Humaydah ibn Abi Numayy. Now that was one mean king.

As a result, during the hajj of 710 AH (1311) they left Mecca to avoid an Egyptian force that was sent against them. The Egyptian emirs were Sayf al-Din Taqsuba al-Nasiri, Wali of Qus and commander of the army, Sayf al-Din Baktamur, Sarim al-Din Saruja al-Husami, and Ala al-Din Aydughdi al-Khwarizmi. Six days before the army's arrival, Humaydah loaded up a hundred camels with money and goods, burned what was left in the castle at Wadi Marr, and destroyed two thousand date palms. Uljaytu, who was a convert to Twelver Shi'ism, also planned to exhume the bodies of the caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar from their graves in Medina. On Tuesday, 4 Dhu al-Hijjah 714 AH (11 March 1315), Humaydah faced and defeated Abu al-Ghayth's larger force near Mecca. However, they managed to escape and when the hajj season arrived they gained the favor of the Egyptian emirs, chief among them Baybars al-Jashnakir. Abu al-Ghayth was injured in the battle and captured, then executed on Humaydah's orders at Khayf Bani Shadid. They were joined from Damascus by the emir Sayf al-Din Balaban al-Tatari. The Ilkhanid khutbah was short-lived, however, for in late Rabi I (May 1318) al-Nasir sent an army which restored Rumaythah to the throne. Rumaythah informed al-Nasir, and the sultan wrote to Humaydah that if he came to Egypt he would be granted safety and pardon, but he could not stay in the Hejaz.

They provided him whatever he needed, but afterwards Humaydah and his companions disappeared, so the emirs returned to Cairo empty-handed. Humaydah sent a tribute to al-Nasir in an attempt to regain his favor, but it was not accepted and his messenger was imprisoned. He replaced the name of al-Nasir in the khutbah with that of Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan, son of Uljaytu. Humaydah initially refused to wear the dress before he was threatened with imprisonment. In Rabi I (May 1317) al-Nasir sent the emirs Sayf al-Din Aytamush al-Muhammadi and Sayf al-Din Bahadur al-Sa'di to bring Humaydah and his companions back to Egypt. In 703 AH the brothers were released from prison. The sultan al-Nasir Muhammad dressed them in traditional Mamluk costume with kalafatah caps of zarkash (brocade). They rode with the sultan on the maydan (parade grounds), and Humaydah played polo with the sultan. They accompanied the annual hajj caravan from Cairo, and in Dhu al-Hijjah 704 AH (July 1305), after the completion of the hajj rites, Baybars al-Jashnakir arrested Abu al-Ghayth and Utayfah and installed Humaydah and Rumaythah to the throne. The Egyptian army reached Mecca with Rumaythah on 15 Ramadan (13 December). Thereafter the brothers were granted stipends and joined the ranks of the sultan's emirs.

How about that Shaohao. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

Another legend says that his mother, a weaver goddess, was a beautiful fairy named Huang'e who fell in love with the planet Venus while drifting along the Milky Way. However, Shiji listed no emperor between the Yellow Emperor and Zhuanxu. Other birds worked below him, such as a phoenix as his Lord Chancellor, a hawk that delegated the law, and a pigeon that was in charge of education. Shaohao and Kim Yu-sin The Samguk Sagi that Kim Yu-sin was of the ethnic Shaohao race. As the ruler of this bureaucratic land, he captured the identity of a vulture. Shaohao is mentioned as a person living between the two who was fretting over an incompetent son, who was derided as Qiongji (窮奇; literally "Thoroughly Odd"). With a different son, Ru Shou, he made his home on Changliu Mountain, where he could rule over the Western Heavens. The two enjoyed many intimate nights together on her raft and they created a son. If Shaohao were to be identified with Xuanxiao (Hanzi:玄囂), the oldest son of the Yellow Emperor found earlier in the text; the incompetent Qiongji would be identified with Jiaoji (Hanzi:蟜極), Xuanxiao's only known offspring, who was also passed over as emperor. The historicity of Shaohao is controversial. Whether, and at what point, Shaohao was inserted into the narrative of ancient Chinese rulers remains controversial amongst historians. Shaohao is usually identified as a son of the Yellow Emperor. The Doubting Antiquity School of historians, represented by Gu Jiegang, posited that Shaohao was inserted into the orthodox legendary lineage of ancient rulers by Han Dynasty imperial librarian Liu Xin, as part of a wide-ranging campaign of editing ancient texts, in order to either justify the rule of the Han imperial house, or the brief Xin Dynasty that overthrew it. The tomb enclosure also includes a pyramidal monument called Shou Qiu, which according to legend was the birthplace of the Yellow Emperor. Ruling for eighty-four years, he was succeeded by his nephew Zhuanxu, the son of his brother Changyi. His great uncle, the Yellow Emperor, was so impressed with him that he named him god of the Western Heavens. In union as father and son, they were responsible for the daily setting of the sun.

There's this one -- Ashur-nadin-apli. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

The alternate dating is due to uncertainty over the length of reign of a later monarch, Ninurta-apal-Ekur, where conflicting king lists differ by ten years. Copies of the Assyrian King List record that "Aššūr-nādin or nāṣir-apli,[i 3] his son, seized the throne (for himself and) ruled for three or four[i 4] years." "[i 5] It was Aššūr-nādin-apli who succeeded to the throne, as testified by the scanty inscriptions left behind, which include bricks[i 2] from Assur (line art pictured), "(Property of) the palace of Aššūr-nādin-apli …" and a lengthy text on a stone tablet commemorating rerouting the Tigris to the north of the city by "divine means" to recover agricultural fields and the erection of a shrine. Just one eponym has been positively identified for his rule, that of Erīb-Sîn, which dates the stone tablet. His military conquests seem to have taken place during the first half of his reign with modern scholarship suggesting that his climactic victory against Kaštiliašu IV and the city of Babylon occurred during two campaigns during his thirteenth and fifteenth years, if the placing of the eponyms, the Assyrian dating system, of Etel-pi-Aššur and Aššur-bel-ilani are correct. The king of Tâbatu was an Assyrian official named Adad-bēl-gabbe whose rule spanned that of four Assyrian monarchs seemingly unaffected by the turmoil at the heart of the empire. The Nassouhi King List (NaKL) and the Khorsabad King List (KhKL) say Aššūr-nādin-apli but the Seventh Day Adventist Seminary King List (SDAS) says Aššūr-nāṣir-apli. The names differ by just one cuneiform character, PAB for nāṣir and SUM for nādin. A tablet also dated to this year was found at Tell Taban, site of the vassal state of Tâbatu near modern Al-Hasakah during salvage excavation under the direction of Hirotoshi Numoto in advance of the building of a dam in northeastern Syria. He was succeeded by Aššur-nerari III, who was either his son or his nephew, again depending on the existence of Aššūr-naṣir-apli.

Now let me tell you about Bazaya. Mean? I'm not so sure.

He reigned for twenty-eight years and has left no known inscriptions. The literal reading of the list was challenged by Landsberger who suggested that the three preceding kings, Libaya, Sharma-Adad I and Iptar-Sin may have been Bel-bani's brothers. He was succeeded by Lullaya, a usurper, whose brief reign was followed by that of Bāzāiu’s own son, Shu-Ninua.

How about that Arcesilaus III of Cyrene. Now that was one mean king.

Arcesilaus subsequently ignored the priestess' advice. First reign and exile When his father died in 530 BC, Arcesilaus became the new king. Although his maternal grandparents are unknown, his paternal grandparents were the queen Eryxo and king Arcesilaus II. His sister was Ladice, who married the Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Amasis II. After her death, she was succeeded by Arcesilaus's only son, Battus IV. Arcesilaus was buried near his paternal ancestors in Cyrene. For other uses, see Arcesilaus (disambiguation). The exiles approached the two men and killed them. He succeeded his father as king of Cyrene in 530 BC and was ruler until he was killed by Cyrenaean exiles around 515 BC. She also advised him to be careful in how he treated the Cyrenaean citizens and that if he were cruel to them, they would go against him. Once he got his army together, he travelled to the oracle at Delphi to consult about his future in Cyrene. She advised him to make no attempt to keep power beyond that period. In 525 BC, Arcesilaus made an alliance with the King Cambyses II of Persia.

In many ways, we're really talking about Acamapichtli. Now that was one mean king.

Built in the middle of Lake Texcoco, Tenochtitlan suffered from limited farmland. After the death of his father, Huitzilíhuitl consolidated his power by ordering a new election, with more electors, including important warriors and priests. Acamapichtili approved the election, and then died. On the death of Tenoch in 1375, the elders of the Mexica calpultin decided to elect a tlatoani who could secure the fledgling city's position through ties to powerful groups in the region. Blood relationships between rulers were an important aspect of politics in 14th century Mexico, and as relative newcomers, the Mexicans were at a disadvantage. In spite of the hostility of Azcapotzalco, Tenochtitlan progressed. (in Spanish) "Acamapichtili", Enciclopedia de México, v. 1. He avoided difficulties with the more powerful rulers, in the case of Tezozómoc, by paying the demanded tribute. Acamapichtli built up the city's agricultural base by expanding the chinampa system ("floating" gardens) around the island, and by capturing lakeshore chinampas from other cities, particularly Xochimilco. This same ceremony was repeated in all the subsequent Aztec coronations, with the difference that, from 1427, the new tlatoani was accompanied by the rulers of Texcoco and Tlacopan, the other two towns of the Aztec Triple Alliance. Despite Acamapichtli's Culhua ancestry, his city rapidly fell into the Tepanec orbit and became a tributary of Azcapotzalco. She was of noble birth, but had been captured and enslaved. She was the mother of Huitzilíhuitl, who succeeded to the throne after the death of his father. He ascended the steps accompanied by the highest-ranking warriors. The Mexica were careful, however, to maintain a proper distance from the mainland, for defensive purposes in the event of war. A great temple, or teocalli, was also constructed. Before the death of Acamapichtili, they chose his eldest son Huitzilíhuitl. In 1382, Acamapichtli was named tlatoani. Houses of cane and reeds were replaced with houses of stone. It is said that during his reign, the first Aztec laws were made. After his acceptance of the throne, he was brought to Tenochtitlan and made his entry into the city with great pomp. During his reign, the city was divided into four neighborhoods or calpullis: Moyotlán in the southwest; Zoquipan in the southeast; Cuecopan in the northwest; and Atzacualco in the northeast. Another son of Acamapichtli, Itzcóatl, also became tlatoani in 1427. Acamapichtli was the product of one such union. In the same year, Tenochtitlan's sister city of Tlatelolco also installed an outsider as tlatoani — Cuacuapitzahuac, son of Tezozómoc, tlatoani of the Tepanec city of Azcapotzalco, the other major power in the region.

Of course, there's John Baker (Baker Brook). I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

He was buried in Baker Brook but would not be allowed to rest for all eternity. His devotion to the cause of Maine was superseded by his own economic interests, and he remained in New Brunswick after the boundary settlement, grudgingly tolerating British sovereignty but never ceasing to consider himself nothing but an American. He was a successful sawmill and gristmill businessman who became a well-known pro-American activist in New Brunswick and Maine during the 19th century and was nicknamed "the Washington of the Republic of Madawaska",[dubious  – discuss] which he had declared in response to the unwillingness of the Van Buren Administration in Washington to support Maine's claim to sizable areas of territory covering adjacent parts of the British colonies of Lower-Canada and New Brunswick, part of British North America. This had resulted in Washington adopting a policy of appeasement towards states with claims to British territories, which clashed with Maine's expansionist intentions that continued to simmer during the 1830s. [dubious  – discuss] The state of Maine considers him a champion of American values. Outside of Baker Brook, few heard bout him and the origins of the Republic were relegated to vague local legends. He had homes on both sides of the disputed territory, defied the officers of New Brunswick in many ways and was twice arrested and imprisoned in the Fredericton jail, where a statue and plaque today recognize his imprisonments and his contributions to the boundary settlement, as involuntary as they may have been. [dubious  – discuss] "Brayons" as French Canadians of the area are colloquially called, honor him as the founder of the "Republic of Madawaska", the strongest symbol of their unique identity.

He had also further endeared himself to French Canadians by supporting the establishment of a Roman Catholic mission[dubious  – discuss] in Baker Brook, which had never had as much as a chapel of any faith prior. John Baker died at his country home on Chaleur Bay in 1868, shortly after New Brunswick had become part of the new sovereign country of Canada. Baker also had several facilities in the actual state of Maine but these were less substantial. The steady rise of the Catholic Church's control over French Canadian educational and cultural institutions after 1840 had reached the area and found no reason to perpetuate the memory of a Protestant as a positive asset in local French Canadian history. By 1840 John Baker was in his mid-forties and his expanding[dubious  – discuss] business had become his main concern. Baker was instrumental in the Aroostook War, a boundary dispute that led to resolution of the imprecise 1783 international border between New Brunswick and the state of Maine.

In 1895, his remains were transported to Fort Fairfield, Maine where a memorial to him as a "Maine Hero" had been established, owing to the efforts of his daughter.

Years ago, I read about Siraj ud-Daulah. Now that was one mean king.

Then, with his principal consort Lutf-un-Nisa and very few attendants, Siraj began his escape towards Patna by boat, but was eventually arrested by Mir Jafar's soldiers. How did he escape afterwards?". The event took place, and success attended it; and the House, I am fully persuaded, will agree with me, that, when the very existence of the company was at stake, and the lives of these people so precariously situated, and so certain of being destroyed, it was a matter of true policy and of justice to deceive so great a villain. "We all know Siraj-ud-Daulah lost the Battle of Plassey. As to the person who signed Admiral Watson's name to the treaty, whether he did it in his presence or not, I cannot say; but this I know, that he thought he had sufficient authority for so doing. Siraju-d-daulah treated all the noblemen and capable generals of Mahabat Jang with ridicule and drollery and bestowed on each some contemptuous nick-name that ill-suited any of them. William Watts, the Company representative at the court of Siraj, informed Clive about a conspiracy at the court to overthrow the ruler. When communicated in this regard by Mir Jafar, Clive referred it to the select committee in Calcutta on 1 May. Siraj was regarded as the "fortune child" of the family. Mr Watts, immediately on this information, dispatched an express to me at the council. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. The committee passed a resolution in support of the alliance. Ghaseti Begum possessed huge wealth, which was the source of her influence and strength. He ordered his principal commanders to engage their troops for his safety, but as he was bereft of power due to the loss at Plassey, they were reluctant to offer unquestioning support. Betrayed by a conspiracy plotted by Jagat Seth, Mir Jafar, Krishna Chandra, Omichund etc., he lost the battle and had to escape. On 2 May, Clive broke up his camp and sent half the troops to Calcutta and the other half to Chandernagar. He was very young, not 20 years old when he was put to death—and the first provocation to his enmity was given by the English. Mir Jafar advised Siraj to retreat for that day. We, therefore, made such an agreement as was necessary for the purpose, and entered into a treaty with him to satisfy his demands. Alivardi Khan died at 5am on  9 April 1756 at the age of eighty. Eventually, Siraj suppressed Shaukat Jang, governor of Purnia, who was killed in a clash. On 23 June 1757 Siraj-ud-Daulah called on Mir Jafar because he was saddened by the sudden fall of Mir Mardan who was a very dear companion of Siraj in battles. Therefore, he could not deploy his entire force against the British for fear of being attacked from the flanks. It is marked with a simple but elegant one-storied mausoleum, surrounded by gardens. I remember a similar accident happening in St. Martin's roundhouse, but it should appear very ridiculous, were I, on that account, to attribute any guilt or imputation of cruelty to the memory of the late king, in whose reign it happened. So all fled away in such a situation. Actually the East India Company tried their best to propagate a false story of black hole killing among the people to raise them against Nawab Siraj ud-Daula. And whatever harsh expressions and abusive epithet came to his lips, Siraju-d-daulah uttered them unhesitatingly in the face of everyone, and no one had the boldness to breathe freely in his presence. The Nawab asked for help from Mir Jafar. In a little time, he became as detested as Pharao. The Nawab also moved a large division of his army under Rai Durlabh to Plassey, on the island of Cossimbazar 30 miles (48 km) south of Murshidabad. People on meeting him by chance used to say, God save us from him! Some advised him to deliver himself up to the English, but Siraj equated this with treachery. In May 1752, Alivardi Khan declared Siraj as his successor. The Company did not heed his directives; consequently, Siraj retaliated and captured Kolkata (for a short while renamed Alinagar) from the British in June 1756. They had engaged Yar Lutuf Khan to defend them in case they were threatened in any way. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. At such a sudden attack, the army of Siraj became indisciplined and could think of no way to fight. As a result, Siraj started secret negotiations with Jean Law, chief of the French factory at Cossimbazar, and de Bussy. I did not hesitate to find out a stratagem to save the lives of these people, and secure success to the intended event. The Nawab gathered his forces together and took Fort William. Apprehending serious opposition from her, Siraj ud-Daulah seized her wealth from Motijheel Palace and placed her under confinement. Hearing of this, Clive suggested an expedient to the committee. When all things were prepared, and the evening of the event was appointed, Omichund informed Mr Watts, who was at the court of the nawab, that he insisted upon thirty lacks of rupees, and five per cent. Archived from the original on 22 February 2018. "4 hospitals fined, two of them asked to shut". He suggested that two treaties be drawn – the real one on white paper, containing no reference to Omichund and the other on red paper, containing Omichund's desired stipulation, to deceive him. The captives were placed in the prison cell as a temporary holding by a local commander, but there was confusion in the Indian chain of command, and the captives were left there overnight, and many died. Others proposed he should encourage the army with greater rewards, and this he seemed to approve of. Young Siraj also accompanied Alivardi on his military ventures against the Marathas in 1746. (February 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Siraj ud-Daulah is usually seen as a freedom fighter in modern India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan for his opposition to the beginning of British rule over India. Finding this to be the man in whom the nawab entirely trusted, it soon became our object to consider him as a most material engine in the intended revolution.

Te Rau-angaanga was only able to muster 3,000 warriors, but defeated and repelled the army facing him just south of Ohaupo, half way between Hamilton and Te Awamutu, at the Battle of Hingakaka, considered to be the largest battle ever fought on the New Zealand mainland. His son Pōtatau Te Wherowhero became the first Maori king. Pikauterangi, of Ngāti Toa, had formed a coalition of southern and eastern tribes to invade the Waikato. His army mustered some 10,000 warriors according to the oral tradition of the Waikato people.

Who could forget Merikare. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

Some scholars tend to identify Merikare's predecessor with Wahkare Khety. Merikare died in c. 2040 BCE, a few months before the fall of Herakleopolis. They include Gemniemhat who also held other important positions. In the text, Merikare's unnamed father mentions having sacked Thinis, but he advises Merikare to deal more leniently with the troublesome Upper Egyptian realms. The titles of the officials involved in its construction are documented, as his funerary cult endured into the 12th Dynasty; in fact, Merikare's cartouche appears on the stelae of at least four priests who were responsible for the funerary cult of Teti and Merikare during the Middle Kingdom. After that, Merikare advanced farther upstream to the town of Shashotep, likely to quell a revolt, and at the same time as a show of force to the turbulent southern border areas. According to him, if Merikare reigned during the campaign led by Mentuhotep II then the former's pyramid and its cult couldn't have survived the Theban conquest; again, Merikare likely would not be able to obtain granite from the South as mentioned in the Teachings. Attestations Despite his name cannot be recognized in the Turin King List, Merikare is the most attested among the Herakleopolite rulers. Heft 8: Die Lehre für König Merikarê. An introduction, Oxford University Press, 1961, p. 113. Demidchik also argued that the battles for Thinis mentioned by Tefibi and Merikare were the same, being fought in the opposite front by the Theban ruler Wahankh Intef II, thus suggesting that Merikare's reign should be placed some decades earlier than usually thought, when the 10th Dynasty's power was at its peak. a b Jürgen von Beckerath, Handbuch der Ägyptischen Königsnamen, 2nd edition, Mainz, 1999, p. 74.

I've heard about Puzur-Ashur I. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

c. 2025 BC — c. 1950 BCPredecessorAkiyaSuccessorShalim-ahum Puzur-Ashur I (Akkadian: 𒁍𒀫𒀸𒋩, romanized: Pu-AMAR-Aš-ŠUR) was an Assyrian king around 2000 BC. He is in the Assyrian King List and is referenced in the inscriptions of later kings (his son and successor Shalim-ahum and the later Ashur-rim-nisheshu and Shalmaneser III. Please help improve this section or discuss this issue on the talk page. ):6,8,12,15 These later kings mentioned him among the kings who had renewed the city walls of Assur begun by Kikkia. Hildegard Levy, writing in the Cambridge Ancient History, rejects this interpretation and sees Puzur-Aššur I as part of a longer dynasty started by one of his predecessors, Sulili.

Of course, there's Leonidas I. Now that was one mean king.

Herodotus himself believed that Leonidas gave the order because he perceived the allies to be disheartened and unwilling to encounter the danger to which his own mind was made up. On the seventh day (August 11), a Malian Greek traitor named Ephialtes led the Persian general Hydarnes by a mountain track to the rear of the Greeks. This was considered sacrilegious. He succeeded his half-brother King Cleomenes I to the throne in c. 489 BC. He therefore chose to dismiss all troops except the Thebans, Thespians and helots and save the glory for the Spartans. He appears as the protagonist of Frank Miller's 1998 comic book series 300. However, one year after Cleomenes' birth, Anaxandridas' first wife also gave birth to a son, Dorieus. Whatever the reason Sparta's own contribution was just 300 Spartiates (accompanied by their attendants and probably perioikoi auxiliaries), the total force assembled for the defense of the pass of Thermopylae came to something between four and seven thousand Greeks. The Thespians stayed entirely of their own will, declaring that they would not abandon Leonidas and his followers. Additionally, Leonidas's spear is an important plot point as it is one of many powerful ancient artifacts in the Assassin's Creed lore, as well as wielded by Kassandra/Alexios in combat throughout the game. Archived from the original on 2009-12-17. There are various theories on why Leonidas was accompanied by such a small force of hoplites. They faced a Persian army who had invaded from the north of Greece under Xerxes I. Herodotus stated that this army consisted of over two million men; modern scholars consider this to be an exaggeration and give estimates ranging from 70,000 to 300,000. Helena P. Schrader has produced a three-part biographical novel on Leonidas. I declare that he will not be restrained until he utterly tears apart one of these. Herodotus says that Xerxes' orders were to have Leonidas' head cut off and put on a stake and his body crucified. Gerard Butler in the 2007 film 300, inspired by the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. Literature  Leonidas I as depicted at the top of the monument to Felice Cavallotti in Milan, created by  Ernesto Bazzaro in 1906. Finally, on the fifth day the Persians attacked. Plutarch has recorded the following:  "When someone said to him: 'Except for being king you are not at all superior to us,' Leonidas son of Anaxandridas and brother of Cleomenes replied: 'But were I not better than you, I should not be king. Leonidas had a notable participation in the Second Persian War, where he led the allied Greek forces to a last stand at the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC) while attempting to defend the pass from the invading Persian army; he died at the battle and entered myth as the leader of the 300 Spartans. The King would have thought it wise to preserve those Greek troops for future battles against the Persians, but he knew that the Spartans could never abandon their post on the battlefield. The rejection of Leotychidas and Pausanias was not a reflection on Spartan arms. According to Herodotus, "the Spartans sent the men with Leonidas on ahead so that the rest of the allies would see them and march with no fear of defeat, instead of medizing like the others if they learned that the Spartans were delaying. Achaemenid king killing a Greek hoplite. The might of bulls or lions will not restrain him with opposing strength; for he has the might of Zeus. His co-ruler was King Leotychidas. A sign, under the statue, reads simply: "ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ" ("Come and take them"), which was Leonidas' reply when Xerxes offered to spare the lives of the Spartans if they gave up their arms. Sparta's military reputation had never stood in higher regard, nor was Sparta less powerful in 478 BC than it had been in 481 BC. Anaxandridas refused, claiming his wife was blameless, whereupon the ephors agreed to allow him to take a second wife without setting aside his first. At that point Leonidas sent away all Greek troops and remained in the pass with his 300 Spartans, 900 helots, 400 Thebans and 700 Thespians. When Leonidas was killed, the Spartans retrieved his body after driving back the Persians four times. Leonidas was heir to the Agiad throne and a full citizen (homoios) at the time of the Battle of Sepeia against Argos (c. 494 BC). He is a central figure in Steven Pressfield's novel Gates of Fire. After completing their festival, the Carneia, they left their garrison at Sparta and marched in full force towards Thermopylae.

A few of his building inscriptions were found at Assur. He rebuilt part of the temple of Ishtar in his capital, Ashur, and the southern parts of the city wall.

Who could forget Al-Ashraf Umar II. Pretty nice as far as kings go.

He then uses the compass to determine the north point, the meridian (khaṭṭ niṣf al-nahār), and the Qibla towards Mecca. In a treatise about astrolabes and sundials, al-Ashraf includes several paragraphs on the construction of a compass bowl (ṭāsa).

Let's consider Elephant . Was known to have a pretty regular mean streak.

Other Egyptologists, such as Peter Kaplony and Toby Wilkinson, are not so sure and propose different readings. According to Dreyer, Elephant's name appears in incised rock inscriptions at Qustul and Gebel Sheikh-Suleiman, where the hieroglyphs are put inside a royal serekh. Morenz thinks alike but is highly uncertain about the reading of the name. Dreyer sees a cube-shaped throne seat and a walking elephant beneath it and reads Pen-Abu ("Great one from the (throne) seat"). He believes that the name of the palatinate was created out of King Elephant's name. They are convinced that Elephant was a local king who ruled at the region of Qustul. Kaplony also mentions that the name of a certain 1st-dynasty palatinate named Hor-Sekhentydjw was also written with the wine-jar holder symbol.

I'd like to address the legacy of Attambelos II. Pretty nice as far as kings go.

His rule was from 17/16 to 9/8BC. He is known only from his coins, which have been found as far away as Susa and on Failaka Island in the Persian Gulf.

There's this one -- Elephant . Was known to have a pretty regular mean streak.

Morenz thinks alike but is highly uncertain about the reading of the name. Alternatively, he proposes a rhinoceros as a royal animal. According to Dreyer, Elephant's name appears in incised rock inscriptions at Qustul and Gebel Sheikh-Suleiman, where the hieroglyphs are put inside a royal serekh. On ivory tags found at Abydos, the Elephant appears without any other royal crest. In: Archäologische Veröffentlichungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts Kairo (AV), vol.

How about that Hammurabi II. Pretty nice as far as kings go.

The Alalakh tablets AlT 21 and AlT 22, (naturally made before the destruction of Alalakh) mentions Hammurabi as king, while the Hammurabi mentioned in the Hittites annals (after the destruction of Alalakh) was attested as the son of king Yarim-Lim and since the destruction of Alalakh occurred while Yarim-Lim III was king, then the Hammurabi in tablets AlT 21 and 22 can not be the same Hammurabi, son and successor of Yarim-Lim III.

Let's consider Sneferka. I'd go so far as to say "pretty benevolent", all-told.

In contrast, Egyptologist Kim Ryholt believes that Sneferka ruled during the midst of 2nd Dynasty and was to be identified with Neferkara I, attested in Ramesside sources. A fourth artifact with Sneferka's name is found in the private Georges-Michailidis-Collection but its authenticity is questioned by archaeologists and Egyptologists, since its origin is unknown. A piece of evidence supporting this theory is the Horus name of Hotepsekhemwy which means "The two powers are reconciled", and could relate to a re-unification of the Egyptian realm after a period of discord. This behavior was typical for kings who ruled somewhat later than the original owner of the re-used artefacts and who ruled for a very short time only. SneferkaNeferseka, Sekanefer, NeferkaesSlate fragment bearing Sneferka's serekh from SaqqaraPharaohReignshort, ca. Egyptologists such as Peter Kaplony conclude that the inscriptions prove a chronological adjacency to king Qa'a or that the name "Sneferka" was an alternative name that Qa'a bore for a short time. He points to the circumstance that Ramesside scribes often added the symbol of the sun to the names of early dynastic kings, ignoring the fact that the sun was not yet an object of divine adoration at that early time. The struggles peaked in the plundering of the royal cemetery of Abydos, which was therefore abandoned. - Inscriptions Gravees sur les Vases: Fouilles à Saqqarah. Peter Kaplony: „Er ist ein Liebling der Frauen“ – Ein „neuer“ König und eine neue Theorie zu den Kronprinzen sowie zu den Staatsgöttinnen (Kronengöttinnen) der 1./2. Egyptologist Aidan Dodson thinks alike and points to the fact that nearly all serekhs of Sneferka are made "on erasures", thus leading to the conclusion that Sneferka usurped Qa'a's vessels.
